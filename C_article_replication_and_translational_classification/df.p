aS"Occupational exposure to nickel (Ni) is associated with an increased risk of lung and nasal cancers. Ni compounds exhibit weak mutagenic activity, alter the cell's epigenetic homeostasis, and activate signaling pathways. However, changes in gene expression associated with Ni exposure have only been investigated in vitro. This study was conducted in a Chinese population to determine whether occupational exposure to Ni was associated with differential gene expression profiles in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of Ni-refinery workers when compared with referents.Eight Ni-refinery workers and ten referents were selected. PBMC RNA was extracted and gene expression profiling was conducted using Affymetrix exon arrays. Differentially expressed genes (DEG) between both groups were identified in a global analysis.There were a total of 2,756 DEGs in the Ni-refinery workers relative to the referents [false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted P < 0.05] with 770 upregulated genes and 1,986 downregulated genes. DNA repair and epigenetic genes were significantly overrepresented (P < 0.0002) among the DEGs. Of 31 DNA repair genes, 29 were repressed in the Ni-refinery workers and 2 were overexpressed. Of the 16 epigenetic genes, 12 were repressed in the Ni-refinery workers and 4 were overexpressed.The results of this study indicate that occupational exposure to Ni is associated with alterations in gene expression profiles in PBMCs of subjects.Gene expression may be useful in identifying patterns of deregulation that precede clinical identification of Ni-induced cancers."

aS'Although the principles that balance stem cell self-renewal and differentiation in normal tissue homeostasis are beginning to emerge, it is still unclear whether cancer cells with tumour initiating potential are similarly governed, or whether they have acquired distinct mechanisms to sustain self-renewal and long-term tumour growth. Here we show that the transcription factor Sox2, which is not expressed in normal skin epithelium and is dispensable for epidermal homeostasis, marks tumour initiating cells (TICs) in cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). We demonstrate that Sox2 is required for SCC growth in mouse and human, where it enhances Nrp1/Vegf signalling to promote the expansion of TICs along the tumour-stroma interface. Our findings suggest that distinct transcriptional programmes govern self-renewal and long-term growth of TICs and normal skin epithelial stem and progenitor cells. These programmes present promising diagnostic markers and targets for cancer-specific therapies.'

aS"The pathophysiological process of Alzheimer's disease (AD) begins many years before the emergence of clinical symptoms (preclinical AD). A hypothetical biomarker progression in the pathogenesis of AD has been suggested, beginning with the deposition of amyloid-\xce\xb2 (A\xce\xb2) and followed by increases in neurofibrillary tangles, synaptic loss, hippocampal atrophy, and lastly, cognitive impairment.We explored the effect of several risk factors for AD on the pattern of AD biomarker expression in normal subjects.AD biomarker evidence was examined at baseline in 96 cognitively normal elderly subjects with none or at least one of the following: ApoE4+ allele, a maternal history of AD (mFHx), sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), and longitudinal evidence of decline to mild cognitive impairment or AD (decliners) at follow-up.Decliners and ApoE4+ subjects presented with expected reduced cerebrospinal fluid A\xce\xb242, elevated P-tau and T-tau. In addition, decliners had fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography hypometabolism in the medial temporal lobe. Individuals with mFHx demonstrated no A\xce\xb242 effect, but had elevations in P-tau and T-tau. SDB was found to be associated with elevated A\xce\xb242, P-tau and T-tau, as well as with reduced medial temporal lobe glucose metabolic rates.Our results indicate a heterogeneous biomarker expression, suggesting diversity of AD pathways in at-risk presymptomatic subjects."

aS'To ascertain whether pediatric obesity without clinically significant insulin resistance (IR) impacts brain structure and function.Thirty obese and 30 matched lean adolescents, all without clinically significant IR or a diagnosis of metabolic syndrome (MetS), received comprehensive endocrine, neuropsychological, and MRI evaluations.Relative to lean adolescents, obese non-IR adolescents had significantly lower academic achievement (i.e., arithmetic and spelling) and tended to score lower on working memory, attention, psychomotor efficiency, and mental flexibility. In line with our prior work on adolescent MetS, memory was unaffected in uncomplicated obesity. Reductions in the thickness of the orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortices as well as reductions of microstructural integrity in major white matter tracts without gross volume changes were also uncovered.It was documented, for the first time, that adolescents with uncomplicated obesity already have subtle brain alterations and lower performance in selective cognitive domains. When interpreting these preliminary data in the context of our prior reports of similar, but more extensive brain findings in obese adolescents with MetS and T2DM, it was concluded that "uncomplicated" obesity may also result in subtle brain alterations, suggesting a possible dose effect with more severe metabolic dysregulation giving rise to greater abnormalities.'

aS'The rates of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) continue to parallel the rising rates of obesity in the United States, increasingly affecting adolescents as well as adults. Hippocampal and frontal lobe reductions have been found in older adults with type 2 diabetes, and we sought to ascertain if these brain alterations were also present in obese adolescents with T2DM. In a cross-sectional study we compared MRI-based regional brain volumes of 18 obese adolescents with T2DM and 18 obese controls without evidence of marked insulin resistance. Groups were matched on age, sex, school grade, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, body mass index, and waist circumference. Relative to obese controls, adolescents with T2DM had significantly reduced hippocampal and prefrontal volumes, and higher rates of global cerebral atrophy. Hemoglobin A1c, an index of long-term glycemic control, was inversely associated with prefrontal volume and positively associated with global cerebral atrophy (both p < 0.05). Brain integrity is negatively impacted by T2DM already during adolescence, long before the onset of overt macrovascular disease. Paralleling the findings of greater vascular and renal complications among obese adolescents with severe insulin resistance and T2DM relative to their age-matched peers with type 1 diabetes, we find clear evidence of possible brain complications. Our findings call for aggressive and early intervention to limit the negative impact of obesity-associated insulin resistance leading to T2DM on the developing brains of adolescents.'

aS'We examined intragenomic variation of paralogous 5S rRNA genes to evaluate the concept of ribosomal constraints. In a dataset containing 1161 genomes from 779 unique species, 96 species exhibited >\xc2\xa03% diversity. Twenty-seven species with >\xc2\xa010% diversity contained a total of 421 mismatches between all pairs of the most dissimilar copies of 5S rRNA genes. The large majority (401 of 421) of the diversified positions were conserved at the secondary structure level. The high diversity was associated with partial rRNA operon, split operon, or spacer length-related divergence. In total, these findings indicated that there are tight ribosomal constraints on paralogous 5S rRNA genes in a genome despite of the high degree of diversity at the primary structure level.'

aS'To obtain quantitative neurometabolite measurements, specifically myoinositol (mI) and glutamate plus glutamine (Glx), markers of glial and neuronal excitation, in deep gray matter structures after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) and to compare these measurements against normal healthy control subjects.This study approved by the institutional review board is Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliant. T1-weighted MRI and multi-voxel (1)H-MRS imaging were acquired at 3 tesla from 26 patients with mTBI an average of 22 days postinjury and from 13 age-matched healthy controls. Two-way analysis of variance was used to compare patients and controls for mean N-acetylaspartate, choline, creatine (Cr), Glx, and mI levels as well as the respective ratios to Cr within the caudate, globus pallidus, putamen, and thalamus.Quantitative putaminal mI was higher in patients with mTBI compared with controls (p = 0.02). Quantitative neurometabolite ratios of putaminal mI and Glx relative to Cr, mI/Cr, and Glx/Cr were also higher among patients with mTBI compared with controls (p = 0.01 and 0.02, respectively). No other differences in neurometabolite levels or ratios were observed in any other brain region evaluated.Increased putaminal mI, mI/Cr, and Glx/Cr in patients after mTBI compared with control subjects supports the notion of a complex glial and excitatory response to injury without concomitant neuronal loss, evidenced by preserved N-acetylaspartate levels in this region.'

aS'Antibiotics administered in low doses have been widely used as growth promoters in the agricultural industry since the 1950s, yet the mechanisms for this effect are unclear. Because antimicrobial agents of different classes and varying activity are effective across several vertebrate species, we proposed that such subtherapeutic administration alters the population structure of the gut microbiome as well as its metabolic capabilities. We generated a model of adiposity by giving subtherapeutic antibiotic therapy to young mice and evaluated changes in the composition and capabilities of the gut microbiome. Administration of subtherapeutic antibiotic therapy increased adiposity in young mice and increased hormone levels related to metabolism. We observed substantial taxonomic changes in the microbiome, changes in copies of key genes involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates to short-chain fatty acids, increases in colonic short-chain fatty acid levels, and alterations in the regulation of hepatic metabolism of lipids and cholesterol. In this model, we demonstrate the alteration of early-life murine metabolic homeostasis through antibiotic manipulation.'

aS'Serum anti-M\xc3\xbcllerian hormone (AMH) is linked to the ovarian follicle pool. Little is known about the relationship between serum AMH and ovarian ultrasound (US) features in adolescents with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).To confirm that serum AMH is elevated in adolescents with PCOS and to correlate serum AMH with ovarian US features in this population are the objectives of this study.A retrospective chart review of clinical, biochemical, and ultrasonographic data in adolescents with PCOS and normal controls is the design of the study. Serum AMH was measured and compared between groups and correlated with ovarian US findings.The study was done in two urban tertiary academic medical centers.Study groups included 23 adolescent females with PCOS and 12 age and BMI-matched female controls.We hypothesized that serum AMH would be elevated in the PCOS group compared with the controls and would positively correlate with the follicle number, distribution, and ovarian volume.Serum AMH was 6.78\xc2\xb13.55 ng/mL in the PCOS group vs. 3.38\xc2\xb11.48 ng/mL in the controls (p=0.0004). AMH positively correlated with ovarian volume (left ovary r=0.65, p=0.0007, right ovary r=0.55, p=0.0065) and peripheral follicle distribution (p=0.0027). Ten or more follicles were observed in 83% of USs.There is a positive relationship between serum AMH and ovarian volume as well as peripheral follicular distribution in adolescents with PCOS. Our findings support the use of serum AMH as a useful marker to reflect ovarian US features typical of PCOS in cases where accurate USs are not available and for follow-up.'

aS'The hypothalamus is important in hunger and metabolism. Although a lot is known about the basic role of the human hypothalamus, less is known about how the in vivo volume is affected in obesity, particularly among adolescents. Based on pediatric body mass index percentiles, 95 participants were assigned to lean or obese groups. All subjects had medical evaluations, including fasting blood tests, to assess insulin sensitivity and circulating CRP and neurotrophins (NGF and BDNF) and an MRI of the brain. Hypothalamic volumes were measured by a segmentation method combining manual and automated steps. Overall, obese participants had descriptively smaller hypothalamic volumes, although this difference did not reach statistical significance; however, among obese participants, females had significantly smaller hypothalamic volumes than their male counterparts. There was a significant interaction between insulin resistance and sex on hypothalamus volume; obese females with significant insulin resistance have smaller hypothalamic volumes than obese males. Obese adolescents had higher circulating CRP and neurotrophin levels. Furthermore, among obese females, BDNF concentrations were inversely associated with hypothalamus volumes (r = \xe2\x88\x920.48). Given this negative association between BDNF and hypothalamus volumes among obese insulin-resistant females, elevated neurotrophin levels may suggest an attempt at protective compensation.'

aS'We have developed a mouse model of atherosclerotic plaque regression in which an atherosclerotic aortic arch from a hyperlipidemic donor is transplanted into a normolipidemic recipient, resulting in rapid elimination of cholesterol and monocyte-derived macrophage cells (CD68+) from transplanted vessel walls. To gain a comprehensive view of the differences in gene expression patterns in macrophages associated with regressing compared with progressing atherosclerotic plaque, we compared mRNA expression patterns in CD68+ macrophages extracted from plaque in aortic aches transplanted into normolipidemic or into hyperlipidemic recipients. In CD68+ cells from regressing plaque we observed that genes associated with the contractile apparatus responsible for cellular movement (e.g. actin and myosin) were up-regulated whereas genes related to cell adhesion (e.g. cadherins, vinculin) were down-regulated. In addition, CD68+ cells from regressing plaque were characterized by enhanced expression of genes associated with an anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage phenotype, including arginase I, CD163 and the C-lectin receptor. Our analysis suggests that in regressing plaque CD68+ cells preferentially express genes that reduce cellular adhesion, enhance cellular motility, and overall act to suppress inflammation.'

aS'Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) has been associated with exposure to polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) which are released in the combustion of oil, fuel, gas, garbage, and tobacco. Pregnant women exposed to PAHs are at risk of the effects of these environmental toxins; for example, benzo-\xce\xb1-pyrene (B\xce\xb1P) is able to enter the blood stream and could contribute to IUGR or other developmental abnormalities via effects on the placental cells. Since IUGR has been associated with decreased cord blood concentrations of immunoreactive insulin-like growth factor 1 (ir-IGF-1) and IUGR has been associated with disordered development and fetal programming, we tested the effects of B\xce\xb1P on human placental trophoblast cells in culture.IGF-1 expression and activation was studied using an immortalized human placental trophoblast cell line (HTR-8). The cells were treated with vehicle control or 1 \xc2\xb5mol/L B\xce\xb1P, or 5 \xc2\xb5mol/L B\xce\xb1P for 12 hours. RNA was extracted and the exons of IGF-1 were amplified using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The ir-IGF-1 expression levels were compared using gel electrophoresis. The PCR products were sequenced, and levels of mutation were measured with comparative sequence analysis. A computational protein analysis (computer simulation) was performed in order to assess the potential impact of B\xce\xb1P-associated mutation on IGF-1 protein function.The IGF-1 expression decreased considerably in B\xce\xb1P-treated cells relative to untreated controls (P < .05), also in a dose-dependent manner. Comparative sequence analysis indicated that the level of B\xce\xb1P exposure correlated with the percentage of base pair mutations in IGF-1 nucleotide sequences for both treatment groups (P < .05). Shifts were observed in the open reading frame, indicating a possible change in the IGF-1 start codon. Protein folding simulation analysis indicated that the base pair changes induced by B\xce\xb1P weakened IGF-1-IGF binding protein (IGFBP) interaction.In concordance with the previous findings, exposure of human placental trophoblast cells to B\xce\xb1P exposure results in reduction of IGF-1 expression and base pair mutations. The direct action of B\xce\xb1P on the placenta indicates that it may not be necessary for B\xce\xb1P to access other maternal tissues in order for gene abnormalities to occur. Given that PAHs are known to work through aryl hydrocarbon hydrolase (AHH), these results are likely due to the presence of AHH in HTR cells. Computational modeling of B\xce\xb1P actions on IGF1, substrate-ligand binding, supports the biological premise of this work and underlines the need to determine actual biological effects rather than equating immune to bioactivity of IGF1.'

aS'Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a psychiatric illness characterized by restricted eating and an intense fear of gaining weight. Most individuals with AN are females, diagnosed first during adolescence, 40-80% of whom exhibit excessive exercise, and an equally high number with a history of anxiety disorder. We sought to determine the cellular basis for individual differences in AN vulnerability by using an animal model, activity-based anorexia (ABA), that is induced by combining food restriction (FR) with access to a running wheel that allows voluntary exercise. Previously, we showed that by the fourth day of FR, the ABA group of adolescent female rats exhibit >500% greater levels of non-synaptic \xce\xb14\xce\xb2\xce\xb4-GABAARs at the plasma membrane of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell spines, relative to the levels found in age-matched controls that are not FR and without wheel access. Here, we show that the ABA group exhibits individual differences in body weight loss, with some losing nearly 30%, while others lose only 15%. The individual differences in weight loss are ascribable to individual differences in wheel activity that both precedes and concurs with days of FR. Moreover, the increase in activity during FR correlates strongly and negatively with \xce\xb14\xce\xb2\xce\xb4-GABAAR levels (R=-0.9, p<0.01). This negative correlation is evident within 2days of FR, before body weight loss approaches life-threatening levels for any individual. These findings suggest that increased shunting inhibition by \xce\xb14\xce\xb2\xce\xb4-GABAARs in spines of CA1 pyramidal neurons may participate in the protection against the ABA-inducing environmental factors of severe weight loss by suppressing excitability of the CA1 pyramidal neurons which, in turn, is related indirectly to suppression of excessive exercise. The data also indicate that, although exercise has many health benefits, it can be maladaptive to individuals with low levels of \xce\xb14\xce\xb2\xce\xb4-GABAARs in the CA1, particularly when combined with FR.'

We conclude that TH17 is involved in the immunopathogenesis of ENL and that thalidomide suppresses inflammatory components of TH17, while enhancing other components of TH17 that are potentially involved in CMI.'

aS'Adenosine is an endogenous nucleoside that modulates many physiological processes through four receptor subtypes (A(1), A(2a), A(2b), A(3)). Previous work from our laboratory has uncovered a critical role for adenosine A(1) receptor (A(1) R) in osteoclastogenesis both in vivo and in vitro. Our current work focuses on understanding the details of how A(1) R modulates the receptor activator of NF-\xce\xbaB ligand (RANKL)-induced signaling in osteoclastogenesis. Osteoclasts were generated from mouse bone marrow precursors in the presence of RANKL and macrophage-colony stimulating factor. A pharmacological antagonist of A(1) R (DPCPX) inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation, including osteoclast-specific genes (Acp5, MMP9, \xce\xb2(3) Integrin, \xce\xb1(v) Integrin, and CTSK) and osteoclast-specific transcription factors such as c-fos and nuclear factor of activated T cells cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1) expression in a dose-dependent manner. DPCPX also inhibited RANKL-induced activation of NF-\xce\xbaB and JNK/c-Jun but had little effect on other mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38 and Erk). Finally, immunoprecipitation analysis showed that blockade of A(1)R resulted in disruption of the association of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and transforming growth factor-\xce\xb2-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), a signaling event that is important for activation of NF-\xce\xbaB and JNK, suggesting the participation of adenosine/A(1)R in early signaling of RANKL. Collectively, these data demonstrated an important role of adenosine, through A(1)R in RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis.'

aS'Objectives Obesity is on the rise in the US and is linked to the development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Emerging evidence over the last decade suggests that obesity may also adversely affect executive function and brain structure. Although a great deal of research focuses on how diet affects the brain and cognitive performance, no study focuses on how food choice may be associated with brain integrity. Here we investigated how lean and overweight/obese (o/o) adults differed in their food choices and how brain structure and cognition may be associated with those choices. Design As part of an ongoing study on diabetes and the brain, participants had routine blood work and a research MRI, received a battery of neurocognitive tests, and were instructed to keep a 3-day food diary. Results and conclusions The lean group ate more high quality foods and less low quality foods compared to the o/o group. In the o/o group, high quality food choices were associated with orbitofrontal cortex volume. The lean group performed better than the o/o group on neurocognitive measures of executive function, such as the Stroop Interference Test, the Wisconsin Card Sort Test and the Trail Making Test B-A, and on attention and concentration tasks such as the Digit Symbol Substitution Test. Taken together, these preliminary data suggest that in obesity poor food choices may be associated with frontal cognitive impairments that may be the result of, or contribute to, decreases in orbitofrontal cortex volume. Therefore, longitudinal studies are warranted to investigate a causal link between food choice and executive functioning.'

Interactions between the androgen receptor (AR) and canonical Wnt pathways have been implicated in the development of the genitourinary organs. Here, we investigated the localization and role of LEF1-positive cells during development of the prostate gland in human and in the murine model. We show that during human prostate development, LEF1 is restricted to the basal epithelial layer of the urogenital sinus. During mouse development, Lef1 is also present in the urogenital mesenchyme in addition to the basal epithelial layer of the urogenital sinus. In the course of elongation and branching of the prostatic ducts, Lef1 is localized to the proliferating epithelium at the distal tips of the buds. Notably, during branching morphogenesis, domains of Lef1 and AR are mutually exclusive. We further employed the TOPGAL reporter strain to examine the dynamics of Wnt signaling in the context of prostate regression upon a 7-d treatment with a competitive AR inhibitor, bicalutamide. We found that Wnt/Lef1-positive basal cells are not dependent upon androgen for survival. Furthermore, upon bicalutamide treatment, Wnt/Lef1-positive basal progenitors repopulated the luminal compartment. We conclude that Wnt/Lef1 activity identifies an androgen-independent population of prostate progenitors, which is important for embryonic development and organ maintenance and regeneration in the adult.'

aS'Air pollution contributes to acute exacerbations of asthma and the development of asthma in children and adults. Airway epithelial cells interface innate and adaptive immune responses, and have been proposed to regulate much of the response to pollutants. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is a pivotal cytokine linking innate and Th2 adaptive immune disorders, and is upregulated by environmental pollutants, including ambient particulate matter (PM) and diesel exhaust particles (DEP). We show that DEP and ambient fine PM upregulate TSLP mRNA and human microRNA (hsa-miR)-375 in primary human bronchial epithelial cells (pHBEC). Moreover, transfection of pHBEC with anti-hsa-miR-375 reduced TSLP mRNA in DEP but not TNF-\xce\xb1-treated cells. In silico pathway evaluation suggested the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) as one possible target of miR-375. DEP and ambient fine PM (3 \xce\xbcg/cm(2)) downregulated AhR mRNA. Transfection of mimic-hsa-miR-375 resulted in a small downregulation of AhR mRNA compared with resting AhR mRNA. AhR mRNA was increased in pHBEC treated with DEP after transfection with anti-hsa-miR-375. Our data show that two pollutants, DEP and ambient PM, upregulate TSLP in human bronchial epithelial cells by a mechanism that includes hsa-miR-375 with complex regulatory effects on AhR mRNA. The absence of this pathway in TNF-\xce\xb1-treated cells suggests multiple regulatory pathways for TSLP expression in these cells.'

aS'In adults, obesity has been associated with disinhibited eating, decreased cortical gray matter (GM) volume, and lower performance on cognitive assessments. Much less is known about these relationships in adolescence and there are no studies assessing behavioral, cognitive, and neurostructural measures in the same group of study participants. This study examined the relationship between obesity, executive function, disinhibition, and brain volumes in relatively healthy youth. Participants included 54 obese and 37 lean adolescents. Participants received a cognitive battery, questionnaires of eating behaviors, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Neuropsychological assessments included tasks targeting frontal lobe function. Eating behaviors were determined using the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ), and structural MRIs were performed on a 1.5 T Siemens Avanto MRI System (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) to determine brain GM volumes. Lean and obese adolescents were matched on age, years of education, gender, and socioeconomic status. Relative to lean adolescents, obese participants had significantly higher ratings of disinhibition on the TFEQ, lower performance on the cognitive tests, and lower orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) volume. Disinhibition significantly correlated with BMI, Stroop color-word score, and OFC volume. This is the first report of these associations in adolescents and point to the importance of better understanding the associations between neurostructural deficits and obesity.'

aS'Measurement of telomere length currently requires a large population of cells, which masks telomere length heterogeneity in single cells, or requires FISH in metaphase arrested cells, posing technical challenges. A practical method for measuring telomere length in single cells has been lacking. We established a simple and robust approach for single-cell telomere length measurement (SCT-pqPCR). We first optimized a multiplex preamplification specific for telomeres and reference genes from individual cells, such that the amplicon provides a consistent ratio (T/R) of telomeres (T) to the reference genes (R) by quantitative PCR (qPCR). The average T/R ratio of multiple single cells corresponded closely to that of a given cell population measured by regular qPCR, and correlated with those of telomere restriction fragments (TRF) and quantitative FISH measurements. Furthermore, SCT-pqPCR detected the telomere length for quiescent cells that are inaccessible by quantitative FISH. The reliability of SCT-pqPCR also was confirmed using sister cells from two cell embryos. Telomere length heterogeneity was identified by SCT-pqPCR among cells of various human and mouse cell types. We found that the T/R values of human fibroblasts at later passages and from old donors were lower and more heterogeneous than those of early passages and from young donors, that cancer cell lines show heterogeneous telomere lengths, that human oocytes and polar bodies have nearly identical telomere lengths, and that the telomere lengths progressively increase from the zygote, two-cell to four-cell embryo. This method will facilitate understanding of telomere heterogeneity and its role in tumorigenesis, aging, and associated diseases.'

aS'Pediatric drug development is hampered by biological, clinical, and formulation challenges associated with age-based populations. A primary cause for this lack of development is the inability to accurately predict ontogenic changes that affect pharmacokinetics (PK) in children using traditional preclinical animal models. In response to this issue, our laboratory has conducted a proof-of-concept study to investigate the potential utility of juvenile pigs to serve as surrogates for children during preclinical PK testing of selected rifampin dosage forms. Pigs were surgically modified with jugular vein catheters that were externalized in the dorsal scapular region and connected to an automated blood sampling system (PigTurn-Culex-L). Commercially available rifampin capsules were administered to both 20 and 40\xc2\xa0kg pigs to determine relevant PK parameters. Orally disintegrating tablet formulations of rifampin were also developed and administered to 20\xc2\xa0kg pigs. Plasma samples were prepared from whole blood by centrifugation and analyzed for rifampin content by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Porcine PK parameters were determined from the resultant plasma-concentration time profiles and contrasted with published rifampin PK data in human adults and children. Results indicated significant similarities in dose-normalized absorption and elimination parameters between pigs and humans. Moreover, ontogenic changes observed in porcine PK parameters were consistent with ontogenic changes reported for human PK. These results demonstrate the potential utility of the juvenile porcine model for predicting human pediatric PK for rifampin. Furthermore, utilization of juvenile pigs during formulation testing may provide an alternative approach to expedite reformulation efforts during pediatric drug development.'

aS'Although the hypothalamic orexin system is known to regulate appetitive behaviors and promote wakefulness and arousal (Sakurai, 2007 [56]), this system may also be important in adaptive and pathological anxiety/stress responses (Suzuki et al., 2005 [4]). In a recent study, we demonstrated that CSF orexin levels were significantly higher in patients experiencing panic attacks compared to non-panicking depressed subjects (Johnson et al., 2010 [9]). Furthermore, genetically silencing orexin synthesis or blocking orexin 1 receptors attenuated lactate-induced panic in an animal model of panic disorder. Therefore, in the present study, we tested if orexin (ORX) modulates panic responses and brain pathways activated by two different panicogenic drugs.We conducted a series of pharmacological, behavioral, physiological and immunohistochemical experiments to study the modulation by the orexinergic inputs of anxiety behaviors, autonomic responses, and activation of brain pathways elicited by systemic injections of anxiogenic/panicogenic drugs in rats.We show that systemic injections of two different anxiogenic/panicogenic drugs (FG-7142, an inverse agonist at the benzodiazepine site of the GABA(A) receptor, and caffeine, a nonselective competitive adenosine receptor antagonist) increased c-Fos induction in a specific subset of orexin neurons located in the dorsomedial/perifornical (DMH/PeF) but not the lateral hypothalamus. Pretreating rats with an orexin 1 receptor antagonist attenuated the FG-7142-induced anxiety-like behaviors, increased heart rate, and neuronal activation in key panic pathways, including subregions of the central nucleus of the amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, periaqueductal gray and in the rostroventrolateral medulla.Overall, the data here suggest that the ORX neurons in the DMH/PeF region are critical to eliciting coordinated panic responses and that ORX1 receptor antagonists constitute a potential novel treatment strategy for panic and related anxiety disorders. The neural pathways through which ORX1 receptor antagonists attenuate panic responses involve the extended amygdala, periaqueductal gray, and medullary autonomic centers.'

aS'Acrolein, an \xce\xb1,\xce\xb2-unsaturated aldehyde and a reactive product of lipid peroxidation, has been suggested as a key factor in neural post-traumatic secondary injury in spinal cord injury (SCI), mainly based on in vitro and ex vivo evidence. Here, we demonstrate an increase of acrolein up to 300%; the elevation lasted at least 2 weeks in a rat SCI model. More importantly, hydralazine, a known acrolein scavenger can provide neuroprotection when applied systemically. Besides effectively reducing acrolein, hydralazine treatment also resulted in significant amelioration of tissue damage, motor deficits, and neuropathic pain. This effect was further supported by demonstrating the ability of hydralazine to reach spinal cord tissue at a therapeutic level following intraperitoneal application. This suggests that hydralazine is an effective neuroprotective agent not only in vitro, but in a live animal model of SCI as well. Finally, the role of acrolein in SCI was further validated by the fact that acrolein injection into the spinal cord caused significant SCI-like tissue damage and motor deficits. Taken together, available evidence strongly suggests a critical causal role of acrolein in the pathogenesis of spinal cord trauma. Since acrolein has been linked to a variety of illness and conditions, we believe that acrolein-scavenging measures have the potential to be expanded significantly ensuring a broad impact on human health.'

aS'To adapt to stresses encountered in stationary phase, Gram-negative bacteria utilize the alternative sigma factor RpoS. However, some species lack RpoS; thus, it is unclear how stationary-phase adaptation is regulated in these organisms. Here we defined the growth-phase-dependent transcriptomes of Haemophilus ducreyi, which lacks an RpoS homolog. Compared to mid-log-phase organisms, cells harvested from the stationary phase upregulated genes encoding several virulence determinants and a homolog of hfq. Insertional inactivation of hfq altered the expression of ~16% of the H. ducreyi genes. Importantly, there were a significant overlap and an inverse correlation in the transcript levels of genes differentially expressed in the hfq inactivation mutant relative to its parent and the genes differentially expressed in stationary phase relative to mid-log phase in the parent. Inactivation of hfq downregulated genes in the flp-tad and lspB-lspA2 operons, which encode several virulence determinants. To comply with FDA guidelines for human inoculation experiments, an unmarked hfq deletion mutant was constructed and was fully attenuated for virulence in humans. Inactivation or deletion of hfq downregulated Flp1 and impaired the ability of H. ducreyi to form microcolonies, downregulated DsrA and rendered H. ducreyi serum susceptible, and downregulated LspB and LspA2, which allow H. ducreyi to resist phagocytosis. We propose that, in the absence of an RpoS homolog, Hfq serves as a major contributor of H. ducreyi stationary-phase and virulence gene regulation. The contribution of Hfq to stationary-phase gene regulation may have broad implications for other organisms that lack an RpoS homolog.Pathogenic bacteria encounter a wide range of stresses in their hosts, including nutrient limitation; the ability to sense and respond to such stresses is crucial for bacterial pathogens to successfully establish an infection. Gram-negative bacteria frequently utilize the alternative sigma factor RpoS to adapt to stresses and stationary phase. However, homologs of RpoS are absent in some bacterial pathogens, including Haemophilus ducreyi, which causes chancroid and facilitates the acquisition and transmission of HIV-1. Here, we provide evidence that, in the absence of an RpoS homolog, Hfq serves as a major contributor of stationary-phase gene regulation and that Hfq is required for H. ducreyi to infect humans. To our knowledge, this is the first study describing Hfq as a major contributor of stationary-phase gene regulation in bacteria and the requirement of Hfq for the virulence of a bacterial pathogen in humans.'

aS"'Spice' is an herbal blend that has been reported to produce cannabis-like effects when smoked and is marketed as an alternative to marijuana. Synthetic additives have been identified in numerous 'Spice' preparations from different sources. Common among many of the preparations were the compounds JWH018 and a dimethyloctyl variant of CP47,497 (CP47,497-C8) and, more recently JWH073. The synaptic effects of each of these compounds were uncharacterized. We previously reported that JWH018 is a potent and efficacious CB(1) cannabinoid receptor agonist. In this study we have examined the abilities of CP47,497-C8 and JWH073 to inhibit neurotransmission in cultured autaptic hippocampal neurons. Each inhibited EPSCs with an efficacy and potency similar to JWH018. We also analyzed these compounds' effects on promoting internalization of CB(1) receptors in HEK293 cells stably expressing CB(1) receptors. Similar to our neurotransmission data, CP47,497-C8 internalized CB(1) in a fashion indistinguishable from JWH018. However, JWH073 was less potent and produced slower internalization than JWH018 and CP47,497-C8. It appears that 'Spice' contains a number of cannabinoid receptor agonists that activate CB(1) receptors to inhibit synaptic transmission with similar potencies and efficacies. It is highly probable that the cannabis-like effects of 'Spice' are due to the presence of these and analogous synthetic additives acting on CB(1) receptors."

aS'N-type Ca(2+) channels (CaV2.2) are a nidus for neurotransmitter release and nociceptive transmission. However, the use of CaV2.2 blockers in pain therapeutics is limited by side effects resulting from inhibition of the physiological functions of CaV2.2 within the CNS. We identified an anti-nociceptive peptide (Brittain, J. M., Duarte, D. B., Wilson, S. M., Zhu, W., Ballard, C., Johnson, P. L., Liu, N., Xiong, W., Ripsch, M. S., Wang, Y., Fehrenbacher, J.

(2011) Suppression of inflammatory and neuropathic pain by uncoupling CRMP2 from the presynaptic Ca(2+) channel complex. Nat. Med. 17, 822-829) derived from the axonal collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2), a protein known to bind and enhance CaV2.2 activity. Using a peptide tiling array, we identified novel peptides within the first intracellular loop (CaV2.2(388-402), "L1") and the distal C terminus (CaV1.2(2014-2028) "Ct-dis") that bound CRMP2. Microscale thermophoresis demonstrated micromolar and nanomolar binding affinities between recombinant CRMP2 and synthetic L1 and Ct-dis peptides, respectively. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that CRMP2 association with CaV2.2 was inhibited by L1 and Ct-dis peptides. L1 and Ct-dis, rendered cell-penetrant by fusion with the protein transduction domain of the human immunodeficiency virus TAT protein, were tested in in vitro and in vivo experiments. Depolarization-induced calcium influx in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons was inhibited by both peptides. Ct-dis, but not L1, peptide inhibited depolarization-stimulated release of the neuropeptide transmitter calcitonin gene-related peptide in mouse DRG neurons. Similar results were obtained in DRGs from mice with a heterozygous mutation of Nf1 linked to neurofibromatosis type 1. Ct-dis peptide, administered intraperitoneally, exhibited antinociception in a zalcitabine (2\'-3\'-dideoxycytidine) model of AIDS therapy-induced and tibial nerve injury-related peripheral neuropathy. This study suggests that CaV peptides, by perturbing interactions with the neuromodulator CRMP2, contribute to suppression of neuronal hypersensitivity and nociception.'

aS'Alphavirus dogma has long dictated the production of a discrete set of structural proteins during infection of a cell: capsid, pE2, 6K, and E1. However, bioinformatic analyses of alphavirus genomes (A. E. Firth, B. Y. Chung, M. N. Fleeton, and J. F. Atkins, Virol. J. 5:108, 2008) suggested that a ribosomal frameshifting event occurs during translation of the alphavirus structural polyprotein. Specifically, a frameshift event is suggested to occur during translation of the 6K gene, yielding production of a novel protein, termed transframe (TF), comprised of a C-terminal extension of the 6K protein in the -1 open reading frame (ORF). Here, we validate the findings of Firth and colleagues with respect to the production of the TF protein and begin to characterize the function of TF. Using a mass spectrometry-based approach, we identified TF in purified preparations of both Sindbis and Chikungunya virus particles. We next constructed a panel of Sindbis virus mutants with mutations which alter the production, size, or sequence of TF. We demonstrate that TF is not absolutely required in culture, although disrupting TF production leads to a decrease in virus particle release in both mammalian and insect cells. In a mouse neuropathogenesis model, mortality was <15% in animals infected with the TF mutants, whereas mortality was 95% in animals infected with the wild-type virus. Using a variety of additional assays, we demonstrate that TF retains ion-channel activity analogous to that of 6K and that lack of production of TF does not affect genome replication, particle infectivity, or envelope protein transit to the cell surface. The TF protein therefore represents a previously uncharacterized factor important for alphavirus assembly.'

aS'Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) results from mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene, which encodes the protein neurofibromin. NF1 patients display diverse clinical manifestations, including vascular disease, which results from neointima formation and vessel occlusion. However, the pathogenesis of NF1 vascular disease remains unclear. Vessel wall homeostasis is maintained by complex interactions between vascular and bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs), and neurofibromin regulates the function of each cell type. Therefore, utilizing cre/lox techniques and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation to delete 1 allele of Nf1 in endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, and BMDCs alone, we determined which cell lineage is critical for neointima formation in vivo in mice. Here we demonstrate that heterozygous inactivation of Nf1 in BMDCs alone was necessary and sufficient for neointima formation after vascular injury and provide evidence of vascular inflammation in Nf1+/- mice. Further, analysis of peripheral blood from NF1 patients without overt vascular disease revealed increased concentrations of inflammatory cells and cytokines previously linked to vascular inflammation and vasoocclusive disease. These data provide genetic and cellular evidence of vascular inflammation in NF1 patients and Nf1+/- mice and provide a framework for understanding the pathogenesis of NF1 vasculopathy and potential therapeutic and diagnostic interventions.'

aS'T cells use the \xce\xb1\xce\xb2 TCR to bind peptides presented by MHC proteins (pMHC) on APCs. Formation of a TCR-pMHC complex initiates T cell signaling via a poorly understood process, potentially involving changes in oligomeric state, altered interactions with CD3 subunits, and mechanical stress. These mechanisms could be facilitated by binding-induced changes in the TCR, but the nature and extent of any such alterations are unclear. Using hydrogen/deuterium exchange, we demonstrate that ligation globally rigidifies the TCR, which via entropic and packing effects will promote associations with neighboring proteins and enhance the stability of existing complexes. TCR regions implicated in lateral associations and signaling are particularly affected. Computational modeling demonstrated a high degree of dynamic coupling between the TCR constant and variable domains that is dampened upon ligation. These results raise the possibility that TCR triggering could involve a dynamically driven, allosteric mechanism.'

aS"A genome-wide, whole brain approach to investigate genetic effects on neuroimaging phenotypes for identifying quantitative trait loci is described. The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 1.5 T MRI and genetic dataset was investigated using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and FreeSurfer parcellation followed by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). One hundred forty-two measures of grey matter (GM) density, volume, and cortical thickness were extracted from baseline scans. GWAS, using PLINK, were performed on each phenotype using quality-controlled genotype and scan data including 530,992 of 620,903 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 733 of 818 participants (175 AD, 354 amnestic mild cognitive impairment, MCI, and 204 healthy controls, HC). Hierarchical clustering and heat maps were used to analyze the GWAS results and associations are reported at two significance thresholds (p<10(-7) and p<10(-6)). As expected, SNPs in the APOE and TOMM40 genes were confirmed as markers strongly associated with multiple brain regions. Other top SNPs were proximal to the EPHA4, TP63 and NXPH1 genes. Detailed image analyses of rs6463843 (flanking NXPH1) revealed reduced global and regional GM density across diagnostic groups in TT relative to GG homozygotes. Interaction analysis indicated that AD patients homozygous for the T allele showed differential vulnerability to right hippocampal GM density loss. NXPH1 codes for a protein implicated in promotion of adhesion between dendrites and axons, a key factor in synaptic integrity, the loss of which is a hallmark of AD. A genome-wide, whole brain search strategy has the potential to reveal novel candidate genes and loci warranting further investigation and replication."

aS'Traumatic brain injury (TBI) promotes neural stem/progenitor cell (NSC) proliferation in the adult hippocampus; however, it remains inconclusive whether proliferation of these cells results in newly generated mature neurons, leading to increased neurogenesis. When we traced the fates of proliferating cells labeled with bromodeoxyuridine (5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine, BrdU) we found that the number of BrdU-positive cells increased in the hippocampus of TBI mice compared to the sham control. However, double immunostaining to distinguish their cell types showed that most of these cells were glia, and that only a small subpopulation is newborn granular neurons. There was no significant difference with respect to neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus between the injured and the control mice. These results indicate that TBI promotes cell proliferation including astrocyte activation and NSC proliferation. Nevertheless, the majority of the BrdU-positive cells are glia. The neurogenesis is not increased by TBI. These data suggest that TBI activates through promotion of NSC proliferation an innate repair and/or plasticity mechanism in the brain. However, additional intervention is required to increase neurogenesis for successfully repairing the damaged brain following TBI.'

aS'Traumatic brain injury (TBI) causes cell death predominantly in the cerebral cortex, but there is additional secondary cell death in the hippocampus. We previously found that most of the dying cells in the mouse hippocampus are newborn immature granular neurons in a mouse model of lateral controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury with a moderate level of impact. It is not known how long this selective cell death in the hippocampal dentate gyrus lasts, and how it is induced. Using Fluoro-Jade B and immunohistochemistry, we show that most of the neuron death in the hippocampus occurs within 24 hours after TBI and that cell death continues at low level for at least another 2 weeks in this lateral CCI model. Most of the dying immature granular neurons did not exhibit morphologic characteristics of apoptosis, and only a small subpopulation of the dying cells was positive for apoptotic markers. In contrast, most of the dying cells coexpressed the receptor-interacting protein 1, a marker of necrosis, suggesting that immature neurons mainly died of necrosis. These results indicate that moderate TBI mainly triggers rapid necrotic death of immature neurons in the hippocampus in a mouse CCI model.'

aS'This investigation was designed to examine the hypothesis that impaired function of coronary microvascular large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (BK(Ca)) channels in metabolic syndrome (MetS) significantly attenuates the balance between myocardial oxygen delivery and metabolism at rest and during exercise-induced increases in myocardial oxygen consumption (MVo(2)). Studies were conducted in conscious, chronically instrumented Ossabaw swine fed a normal maintenance diet (11% kcal from fat) or an excess calorie atherogenic diet (43% kcal from fat, 2% cholesterol, 20% kcal from fructose) that induces many common features of MetS. Data were collected under baseline/resting conditions and during graded treadmill exercise before and after selective blockade of BK(Ca) channels with penitrem A (10 microg/kg iv). We found that the exercise-induced increases in blood pressure were significantly elevated in MetS swine. No differences in baseline cardiac function or heart rate were noted. Induction of MetS produced a parallel downward shift in the relationship between coronary venous Po(2) and MVo(2) (P < 0.001) that was accompanied by a marked release of lactate (negative lactate uptake) as MVo(2) was increased with exercise (P < 0.005). Inhibition of BK(Ca) channels with penitrem A did not significantly affect blood pressure, heart rate, or the relationship between coronary venous Po(2) and MVo(2) in lean or MetS swine. These data indicate that BK(Ca) channels are not required for local metabolic control of coronary blood flow under physiological (lean) or pathophysiological (MetS) conditions. Therefore, diminished function of BK(Ca) channels does not contribute to the impairment of myocardial oxygen-supply demand balance in MetS.'

aS'Genomic studies of the pediatric ocular tumor retinoblastoma are paving the way for development of targeted therapies. Robust model systems such as orthotopic xenografts are necessary for testing such therapeutics. One system involves bioluminescence imaging of luciferase-expressing human retinoblastoma cells injected into the vitreous of newborn rat eyes. Although used for several drug studies, the spatial and temporal development of tumors in this model has not been documented. Here, we present a new model to allow analysis of average luciferin flux ([Formula: see text]) through the tumor, a more biologically relevant parameter than peak bioluminescence as traditionally measured. Moreover, we monitored the spatial development of xenografts in the living eye. We engineered Y79 retinoblastoma cells to express a lentivirally-delivered enhanced green fluorescent protein-luciferase fusion protein. In intravitreal xenografts, we assayed bioluminescence and computed [Formula: see text], as well as documented tumor growth by intraocular optical coherence tomography (OCT), brightfield, and fluorescence imaging. In vivo bioluminescence, ex vivo tumor size, and ex vivo fluorescent signal were all highly correlated in orthotopic xenografts. By OCT, xenografts were dense and highly vascularized, with well-defined edges. Small tumors preferentially sat atop the optic nerve head; this morphology was confirmed on histological examination. In vivo, [Formula: see text] in xenografts showed a plateau effect as tumors became bounded by the dimensions of the eye. The combination of [Formula: see text] modeling and in vivo intraocular imaging allows both quantitative and high-resolution, non-invasive spatial analysis of this retinoblastoma model. This technique will be applied to other cell lines and experimental therapeutic trials in the future.'

aS'This study explores the manifestation and measurement of anxiety symptoms in 415 children with ASDs on a 20-item, parent-rated, DSM-IV referenced anxiety scale. In both high and low-functioning children (IQ above vs. below 70), commonly endorsed items assessed restlessness, tension and sleep difficulties. Items requiring verbal expression of worry by the child were rarely endorsed. Higher anxiety was associated with functional language, IQ above 70 and higher scores on several other behavioral measures. Four underlying factors emerged: Generalized Anxiety, Separation Anxiety, Social Anxiety and Over-arousal. Our findings extend our understanding of anxiety across IQ in ASD and provide guidance for improving anxiety outcome measurement.'

aS"Amyloid imaging with [(11)C]Pittsburgh Compound-B (PiB) provides in vivo data on plaque deposition in those with, or at risk for, Alzheimer's disease (AD). We performed a gene-based association analysis of 15 quality-controlled amyloid-pathway associated candidate genes in 103 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative participants. The mean normalized PiB uptake value across four brain regions known to have amyloid deposition in AD was used as a quantitative phenotype. The minor allele of an intronic SNP within DHCR24 was identified and associated with a lower average PiB uptake. Further investigation at whole-brain voxel-wise level indicated that non-carriers of the minor allele had higher PiB uptake in frontal regions compared to carriers. DHCR24 has been previously shown to confer resistance against beta-amyloid and oxidative stress-induced apoptosis, thus our findings support a neuroprotective role. Pathway-based genetic analysis of targeted molecular imaging phenotypes appears promising to help elucidate disease pathophysiology and identify potential therapeutic targets."

aS'The majority of eukaryotic proteins are phosphorylated in vivo, and phosphorylation may be the most common regulatory posttranslational modification. Many proteins are phosphorylated at numerous sites, often by multiple kinases, which may have different functional consequences. Understanding biological functions of phosphorylation events requires methods to detect and quantify individual sites within a substrate. Here we outline a general strategy that addresses this need and relies on the high sensitivity and specificity of selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mass spectrometry, making it potentially useful for studying in vivo phosphorylation without the need to isolate target proteins. Our approach uses label-free quantification for simplicity and general applicability, although it is equally compatible with stable isotope quantification methods. We demonstrate that label-free SRM-based quantification is comparable to conventional assays for measuring the kinetics of phosphatase and kinase reactions in vitro. We also demonstrate the capability of this method to simultaneously measure relative rates of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of substrate mixtures, including individual sites on intact protein substrates in the context of a whole cell extract. This strategy should be particularly useful for characterizing the physiological substrate specificity of kinases and phosphatases and can be applied to studies of other protein modifications as well.'

aS'A complication of diabetes is the inability of wounds to heal in diabetic patients. Diabetic wounds are refractory to healing due to the involvement of activated matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which remodel the tissue resulting in apoptosis. There are no readily available methods that identify active unregulated MMPs. With the use of a novel inhibitor-tethered resin that binds exclusively to the active forms of MMPs, coupled with proteomics, we quantified MMP-8 and MMP-9 in a mouse model of diabetic wounds. Topical treatment with a selective MMP-9 inhibitor led to acceleration of wound healing, re-epithelialization, and significantly attenuated apoptosis. In contrast, selective pharmacological inhibition of MMP-8 delayed wound healing, decreased re-epithelialization, and exhibited high apoptosis. The MMP-9 activity makes the wounds refractory to healing, whereas that of MMP-8 is beneficial. The treatment of diabetic wounds with a selective MMP-9 inhibitor holds great promise in providing heretofore-unavailable opportunities for intervention of this disease.'

aS'Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a serious adverse drug event that is suspected to have a heritable component. We carried out a genome-wide association study of 783 individuals of European ancestry who experienced DILI due to more than 200 implicated drugs.DILI patients from the US-based Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network (n=401) and three international registries (n=382) were genotyped with the Illumina 1Mduo BeadChip and compared with population controls (n=3001). Potential associations were tested in 307 independent Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network cases.After accounting for known major histocompatibility complex risk alleles for flucloxacillin-DILI and amoxicillin/clavulanate-DILI, there were no genome-wide significant associations, including in the major histocompatibility complex region. Stratification of DILI cases according to clinical phenotypes (injury type, latency, age of onset) also did not show significant associations. An analysis of hepatocellular DILI (n=285) restricted to 193 single-nucleotide polymorphisms previously associated with autoimmune disease showed a trend association for rs7574865, in the vicinity of signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 (STAT4) (P=4.5\xc3\x9710(-4)). This association was replicated in an independent cohort of 168 hepatocellular DILI cases (P=0.011 and 1.5\xc3\x9710(-5) for combined cohorts). No significant associations were found with stratification by other clinical or demographic variables.Although not significant at the genome-wide level, the association between hepatocellular DILI and STAT4 is consistent with the emerging role of the immune system in DILI. However, the lack of genome-wide association study findings supports the idea that strong genetic determinants of DILI may be largely drug-specific or may reflect rare genetic variations, which were not assessed in our study.'

aS'Although striatal dopamine (DA) is important in alcohol abuse, the nature of DA release during actual alcohol drinking is unclear, since drinking includes self-administration of both conditioned flavor stimuli (CS) of the alcoholic beverage and subsequent intoxication, the unconditioned stimulus (US).Here, we used a novel self-administration analog to distinguish nucleus accumbens (NAcc) DA responses specific to the CS and US.Right-handed male heavy drinkers (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8926) received three positron emission tomography (PET) scans with the D2/D3 radioligand [(11)C]raclopride (RAC) and performed a pseudo self-administration task that separately administered a flavor CS of either a habitually consumed beer or the appetitive control Gatorade\xc2\xae, concomitant with the US of ethanol intoxication (0.06\xc2\xa0g/dL intravenous (IV) administration) or IV saline. Scan conditions were Gatorade flavor\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89saline (Gat&Sal), Gatorade flavor\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89ethanol (Gat&Eth), and beer flavor\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89ethanol (Beer&Eth).Ethanol (US) reduced RAC binding (inferring DA release) in the left (L) NAcc [Gat&Sal\xe2\x80\x89>\xe2\x80\x89Gat&Eth]. Beer flavor (CS) increased DA in the right (R) NAcc [Gat&Eth\xe2\x80\x89>\xe2\x80\x89Beer&Eth]. The combination of beer flavor and ethanol (CS\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89US), [Gat&Sal\xe2\x80\x89>\xe2\x80\x89Beer&Eth], induced DA release in bilateral NAcc. Self-reported intoxication during scanning correlated with L NAcc DA release. Relative to saline, infusion of ethanol increased alcoholic drink wanting.Our findings suggest lateralized DA function in the NAcc, with L NAcc DA release most reflecting intoxication, R NAcc DA release most reflecting the flavor CS, and the conjoint CS\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89US producing a bilateral NAcc response.'

aS'This investigation examined the mechanisms by which coronary perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT)-derived factors influence vasomotor tone and the PVAT proteome in lean versus obese swine.Coronary arteries from Ossabaw swine were isolated for isometric tension studies. We found that coronary (P=0.03) and mesenteric (P=0.04) but not subcutaneous adipose tissue augmented coronary contractions to KCl (20 mmol/L). Inhibition of CaV1.2 channels with nifedipine (0.1 \xc2\xb5mol/L) or diltiazem (10 \xc2\xb5mol/L) abolished this effect. Coronary PVAT increased baseline tension and potentiated constriction of isolated arteries to prostaglandin F2\xce\xb1 in proportion to the amount of PVAT present (0.1-1.0 g). These effects were elevated in tissues obtained from obese swine and were observed in intact and endothelium denuded arteries. Coronary PVAT also diminished H2O2-mediated vasodilation in lean and, to a lesser extent, in obese arteries. These effects were associated with alterations in the obese coronary PVAT proteome (detected 186 alterations) and elevated voltage-dependent increases in intracellular [Ca(2+)] in obese smooth muscle cells. Further studies revealed that the Rho-kinase inhibitor fasudil (1 \xc2\xb5mol/L) significantly blunted artery contractions to KCl and PVAT in lean but not obese swine. Calpastatin (10 \xce\xbcmol/L) also augmented contractions to levels similar to that observed in the presence of PVAT.Vascular effects of PVAT vary according to anatomic location and are influenced by an obese phenotype. Augmented contractile effects of obese coronary PVAT are related to alterations in the PVAT proteome (eg, calpastatin), Rho-dependent signaling, and the functional contribution of K(+) and CaV1.2 channels to smooth muscle tone.'

aS"Deficits in contrast sensitivity (CS) have been reported in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the extent of these deficits in prodromal AD stages, including mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or even earlier, has not been investigated. In this study, CS was assessed using frequency doubling technology in older adults with AD (n = 10), amnestic MCI (n = 28), cognitive complaints without performance deficits (CC; n = 20), and healthy controls (HC; n = 29). The association between CS and cognition was also evaluated. Finally, the accuracy of CS measures for classifying MCI versus HC was evaluated. CS deficits were found in AD and MCI, while CC showed intermediate performance between MCI and HC. Upper right visual field CS showed the most significant difference among groups. CS was also associated with cognitive performance. Finally, CS measures accurately classified MCI versus HC. The CS deficits in AD and MCI, and intermediate performance in CC, indicate that these measures are sensitive to early AD-associated changes. Therefore, frequency doubling technology-based measures of CS may have promise as a novel AD biomarker."

aS'Deficiencies in vitamins A, D, and E have been linked to night blindness, bone health, and post-liver transplant reperfusion injury. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and predictive factors of fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies in liver transplant candidates. We reviewed the medical records of liver transplant candidates at our center from January 2008 to September 2011. The etiology of cirrhosis, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score, Child-Pugh class, body mass index (BMI), and vitamin A, vitamin E, and vitamin 25-OH-D levels were recorded. Patients were excluded for incomplete laboratory data, short gut syndrome, celiac disease, pancreatic insufficiency, or prior liver transplantation. Sixty-three patients were included. The most common etiologies of liver disease were alcohol (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8923), hepatitis C virus (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8919), and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x895). Vitamin A and D deficiencies were noted in 69.8% and 81.0%, respectively. Only 3.2% of the patients were vitamin E-deficient. There were no documented cases of night blindness. Twenty-five of the 55 patients with bone density measurements had osteopenia, and 10 had osteoporosis. Four patients had vertebral fractures. There was 1 case of posttransplant reperfusion injury in a patient with vitamin E deficiency. In a multivariate analysis, there were no statistically significant predictors for vitamin D deficiency. The Child-Pugh class [odds ratio (OR)\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x896.84, 95% confidence interval (CI)\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x891.52-30.86, P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.01], elevated total bilirubin level (OR\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8944.23, 95% CI\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x895.02-389.41, P\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.001), and elevated BMI (OR\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x891.17, 95% CI\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x891.00-1.36, P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.045) were found to be predictors of vitamin A deficiency. In conclusion, the majority of liver disease patients evaluated for liver transplantation at our center had vitamin A and D deficiencies. The presence or absence of cholestatic liver disease did not predict deficiencies, whereas Child-Pugh class, bilirubin level, and elevated BMI predicted vitamin A deficiency.'

aS'Pediatric cataracts are observed in 1-15 per 10,000 births with 10-25 % of cases attributed to genetic causes; autosomal dominant inheritance is the most commonly observed pattern. Since the specific cataract phenotype is not sufficient to predict which gene is mutated, whole exome sequencing (WES) was utilized to concurrently screen all known cataract genes and to examine novel candidate factors for a disease-causing mutation in probands from 23 pedigrees affected with familial dominant cataract. Review of WES data for 36 known cataract genes identified causative mutations in nine pedigrees (39 %) in CRYAA, CRYBB1, CRYBB3, CRYGC (2), CRYGD, GJA8 (2), and MIP and an additional likely causative mutation in EYA1; the CRYBB3 mutation represents the first dominant allele in this gene and demonstrates incomplete penetrance. Examination of crystallin genes not yet linked to human disease identified a novel cataract gene, CRYBA2, a member of the \xce\xb2\xce\xb3-crystallin superfamily. The p.(Val50Met) mutation in CRYBA2 cosegregated with disease phenotype in a four-generation pedigree with autosomal dominant congenital cataracts with incomplete penetrance. Expression studies detected cryba2 transcripts during early lens development in zebrafish, supporting its role in congenital disease. Our data highlight the extreme genetic heterogeneity of dominant cataract as the eleven causative/likely causative mutations affected nine different genes, and the majority of mutant alleles were novel. Furthermore, these data suggest that less than half of dominant cataract can be explained by mutations in currently known genes.'

aS'The dilute plasma cytokine milieu associated with type 1 diabetes (T1D), while difficult to measure directly, is sufficient to drive transcription in a bioassay that uses healthy leukocytes as reporters. Previously, we reported disease-associated, partially IL-1 dependent, transcriptional signatures in both T1D patients and the BioBreeding (BB) rat model. Here, we examine temporal signatures in congenic BBDR.lyp/lyp rats that develop spontaneous T1D, and BBDR rats where T1D progresses only after immunological perturbation in young animals. After weaning, the BBDR temporal signature showed early coincident induction of transcription related to innate inflammation as well as IL-10- and TGF-\xce\xb2-mediated regulation. BBDR plasma cytokine levels mirrored the signatures showing early inflammation, followed by induction of a regulated state that correlated with failure of virus to induce T1D in older rats. In contrast, the BBDR.lyp/lyp temporal signature exhibited asynchronous dynamics, with delayed induction of inflammatory transcription and later, weaker induction of regulatory transcription, consistent with their deficiency in regulatory T cells. Through longitudinal analyses of plasma-induced signatures in BB rats and a human T1D progressor, we have identified changes in immunoregulatory processes that attenuate a preexisting innate inflammatory state in BBDR rats, suggesting a mechanism underlying the decline in T1D susceptibility with age.'

aS'To study how type 2 diabetes adversely affects brain volumes, changes in volume, and cognitive function.Regional brain volumes and ischemic lesion volumes in 1,366 women, aged 72-89 years, were measured with structural brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Repeat scans were collected an average of 4.7 years later in 698 women. Cross-sectional differences and changes with time between women with and without diabetes were compared. Relationships that cognitive function test scores had with these measures and diabetes were examined.The 145 women with diabetes (10.6%) at the first MRI had smaller total brain volumes (0.6% less; P = 0.05) and smaller gray matter volumes (1.5% less; P = 0.01) but not white matter volumes, both overall and within major lobes. They also had larger ischemic lesion volumes (21.8% greater; P = 0.02), both overall and in gray matter (27.5% greater; P = 0.06), in white matter (18.8% greater; P = 0.02), and across major lobes. Overall, women with diabetes had slightly (nonsignificant) greater loss of total brain volumes (3.02 cc; P = 0.11) and significant increases in total ischemic lesion volumes (9.7% more; P = 0.05) with time relative to those without diabetes. Diabetes was associated with lower scores in global cognitive function and its subdomains. These relative deficits were only partially accounted for by brain volumes and risk factors for cognitive deficits.Diabetes is associated with smaller brain volumes in gray but not white matter and increasing ischemic lesion volumes throughout the brain. These markers are associated with but do not fully account for diabetes-related deficits in cognitive function.'

aS'Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most common surgical emergency in neonates, with a mortality rate between 10 and 50%. The onset of necrotizing enterocolitis is highly variable and associated with numerous risk factors. Prior research has shown that enteral supplementation with intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) decreases the severity of NEC. The aim of this study is to investigate whether IAP is protective to the preterm intestine in the presence of formula feeding and in the absence of NEC.Preterm rat pups were fed formula with or without supplementation with IAP, and intestine was obtained on day of life 3 for analysis of IAP activity, mRNA expression of TNF\xce\xb1, IL-6 and iNOS and permeability and cytokine expression after LPS exposure.There was no difference in the absolute and intestine specific alkaline phosphatase activity in both groups. Rat pups fed IAP had decreased mRNA expression of the inflammatory cytokines TNF\xce\xb1, IL-6 and iNOS. Pups supplemented with IAP had decreased permeability and inflammatory cytokine expression after exposure to LPS ex vivo when compared to formula fed controls.Our results support that IAP is beneficial to preterm intestine and decreases intestinal injury and inflammation caused by LPS.'

aS'Genetic variation in or near the C-type lectin domain family 4 member M (CLEC4M) has been associated with plasma levels of von Willebrand factor (VWF) in healthy individuals. CLEC4M is a lectin receptor with a polymorphic extracellular neck region possessing a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR). A total of 491 participants (318 patients with type 1 von Willebrand disease [VWD] and 173 unaffected family members) were genotyped for the CLEC4M VNTR polymorphism. Family-based association analysis on kindreds with type 1 VWD demonstrated an excess transmission of VNTR 6 to unaffected individuals (P = .0096) and an association of this allele with increased VWF:RCo (P = .029). CLEC4M-Fc bound to VWF. Immunofluorescence and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay demonstrated that HEK 293 cells transfected with CLEC4M bound and internalized VWF. Cells expressing 4 or 9 copies of the CLEC4M neck region VNTR showed reduced interaction with VWF relative to CLEC4M with 7 VNTR (CLEC4M 4%-60% reduction, P < .001; CLEC4M 9%-45% reduction, P = .006). Mice expressing CLEC4M after hydrodynamic liver transfer have a 46% decrease in plasma levels of VWF (P = .0094). CLEC4M binds to and internalizes VWF, and polymorphisms in the CLEC4M gene contribute to variable plasma levels of VWF.'

aS"The Human Genome Project was expected to individualize medicine by rapidly advancing knowledge of common complex disease through discovery of disease-causing genetic variants. However, this has proved challenging. Although linkage analysis has identified replicated chromosomal regions, subsequent detection of causal variants for complex traits has been limited. One explanation for this difficulty is that utilization of association to follow up linkage is problematic given that linkage and association are not required to co-occur. Indeed, co-occurrence is likely to occur only in special circumstances, such as Mendelian inheritance, but cannot be universally expected. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel method, the Variant Impact On Linkage Effect Test (VIOLET), which differs from other quantitative methods in that it is designed to follow up linkage by identifying variants that influence the variance explained by a quantitative trait locus. VIOLET's performance was compared with measured genotype and combined linkage association in two data sets with quantitative traits. Using simulated data, VIOLET had high power to detect the causal variant and reduced false positives compared with standard methods. Using real data, VIOLET identified a single variant, which explained 24% of linkage; this variant exhibited only nominal association (P=0.04) using measured genotype and was not identified by combined linkage association. These results demonstrate that VIOLET is highly specific while retaining low false-negative results. In summary, VIOLET overcomes a barrier to gene discovery and thus may be broadly applicable to identify underlying genetic etiology for traits exhibiting linkage."

aS'BMP4 loss-of-function mutations and deletions have been shown to be associated with ocular, digital, and brain anomalies, but due to the paucity of these reports, the full phenotypic spectrum of human BMP4 mutations is not clear. We screened 133 patients with a variety of ocular disorders for BMP4 coding region mutations or genomic deletions. BMP4 deletions were detected in two patients: a patient affected with SHORT syndrome and a patient with anterior segment anomalies along with craniofacial dysmorphism and cognitive impairment. In addition to this, three intragenic BMP4 mutations were identified. A patient with anophthalmia, microphthalmia with sclerocornea, right-sided diaphragmatic hernia, and hydrocephalus was found to have a c.592C >T (p.R198X) nonsense mutation in BMP4. A frameshift mutation, c.171dupC (p.E58RfsX17), was identified in two half-siblings with anophthalmia/microphthalmia, discordant developmental delay/postaxial polydactyly, and poor growth as well as their unaffected mother; one affected sibling carried an additional BMP4 mutation in the second allele, c.362A > G (p.H121R). This is the first report indicating a role for BMP4 in SHORT syndrome, Axenfeld-Rieger malformation, growth delay, macrocephaly, and diaphragmatic hernia. These results significantly expand the number of reported loss-of-function mutations, further support the critical role of BMP4 in ocular development, and provide additional evidence of variable expression/non-penetrance of BMP4 mutations.'

aS'The outcome of gastrointestinal bleeding in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients is difficult to discern from the literature. Many publications are small, single-center series or are from an era prior to advanced interventional endoscopy, widespread use of proton pump inhibitors or treatment for Helicobacter pylori infections. In this study, we quantify the role of CKD and ESRD as independent predictors of mortality in patients admitted to the hospital with a principal diagnosis of primary upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB).We used the Nationwide Inpatient Sample that contains data on approximately 8 million admissions in 1,000 hospitals chosen to approximate a 20% stratified sample of all US facilities. Patients discharged with the principal diagnosis of primary UGIB, CKD or ESRD were identified through the ninth revision of the International Classification of Diseases, clinical modification (ICD-9-CM) codes. The outcome variables included frequency and in-hospital mortality of UGIB in CKD and ESRD patients as compared to non-CKD patients and were analyzed using logistic regression modeling.In 2007, out of a total of 398,213 admissions with a diagnosis of primary UGIB, 35,985 were in CKD, 14,983 in ESRD, and 347,245 in non-renal disease groups. The OR for primary UGIB hospitalization in CKD and ESRD was 1.30 (95% CI 1.17-1.46) and 1.84 (95% CI 1.61-2.09), respectively. The corresponding all-cause mortality OR was 1.47 (95% CI 1.21-1.78) and 3.02 (95% CI 2.23-4.1), respectively.Patients with CKD or ESRD admitted with primary UGIB have up to three times higher risk of all-cause in-hospital mortality, warranting heightened vigilance by their clinicians.'

aS'Limited understanding of the interpretability of patient-reported pain scores may impact pain management. The current study assessed the minimal clinically significant improvement in pain and pain scores signifying patient-reported need for medication and treatment satisfaction in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD).Patients, 8-18-years-old, with SCD were recruited while receiving treatment for pain. Patients completed initial pain severity ratings using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS). Serial assessments of pain severity, pain relief, perceived need for medication, and treatment satisfaction were completed in the emergency department and the hospitalization. Data were used to calculate the minimal clinically significant improvement in pain and pain scores associated with perceived need for pain medication and treatment satisfaction.Twenty-eight patients completed 305 assessments during 37 total visits. A decrease in pain severity score of 0.97\xe2\x80\x89cm for the VAS and 0.9 for the NRS was found to be the minimum clinically significant improvement in pain. Pain scores >7.45\xe2\x80\x89cm on the VAS or 7.5 on the NRS were suggestive of patient-reported need for pain medication. Pain scores <7.35\xe2\x80\x89cm on the VAS or 8.5 on the NRS were suggestive of patient-reported treatment satisfaction discrimination.The minimal clinical significant improvement was defined for the VAS and NRS and both scales were able to discriminate between important clinical findings including pain relief, need for pain medication, and treatment satisfaction. Collectively, this study provides data to improve our understanding of pain ratings of pediatric patients with SCD.'

aS'Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is characterized by fevers, rash, and arthritis, for which interleukin-1 (IL-1) and IL-6 inhibitors appear to be effective treatments. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), interstitial lung disease (ILD), and alveolar proteinosis (AP) have recently been reported with increased frequency in systemic JIA patients. Our aim was to characterize and compare systemic JIA patients with these complications to a larger cohort of systemic JIA patients.Systemic JIA patients who developed PAH, ILD, and/or AP were identified through an electronic Listserv and their demographic, systemic JIA, and pulmonary disease characteristics as well as their medication exposure information were collected. Patients with these features were compared to a cohort of systemic JIA patients enrolled in the Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) registry.The patients (n = 25) were significantly (P < 0.05) more likely than the CARRA registry cohort (n = 389) to be female; have more systemic features; and have been exposed to an IL-1 inhibitor, tocilizumab, corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, cyclosporine, and cyclophosphamide. Twenty patients (80%) were diagnosed with pulmonary disease after 2004. Twenty patients (80%) had macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) during their disease course and 15 patients (60%) had MAS at pulmonary diagnosis. Sixteen patients had PAH, 5 had AP, and 7 had ILD. Seventeen patients (68%) were taking or recently discontinued (<1 month) a biologic agent at pulmonary symptom onset; 12 patients (48%) were taking anti-IL-1 therapy (primarily anakinra). Seventeen patients (68%) died at a mean of 10.2 months from the diagnosis of pulmonary complications.PAH, AP, and ILD are underrecognized complications of systemic JIA that are frequently fatal. These complications may be the result of severe uncontrolled systemic disease activity and may be influenced by medication exposure.'

aS'The idea that the conceptual system draws on sensory and motor systems has received considerable experimental support in recent years. Whether the tight coupling between sensory-motor and conceptual systems is modulated by factors such as context or task demands is a matter of controversy. Here, we tested the context sensitivity of this coupling by using action verbs in three different types of sentences in an fMRI study: literal action, apt but non-idiomatic action metaphors, and action idioms. Abstract sentences served as a baseline. The result showed involvement of sensory-motor areas for literal and metaphoric action sentences, but not for idiomatic ones. A trend of increasing sensory-motor activation from abstract to idiomatic to metaphoric to literal sentences was seen. These results support a gradual abstraction process whereby the reliance on sensory-motor systems is reduced as the abstractness of meaning as well as conventionalization is increased, highlighting the context sensitive nature of semantic processing.'

aS'Blood pressure (BP) is a dynamic phenotype that varies rapidly to adjust to changing environmental conditions. Standing upright is a recent evolutionary trait, and genetic factors that influence postural adaptations may contribute to BP variability. We studied the effect of posture on the genetics of BP and intermediate BP phenotypes. We included 384 sib-pairs in 64 sib-ships from families ascertained by early-onset hypertension and dyslipidemia. Blood pressure, three hemodynamic and seven neuroendocrine intermediate BP phenotypes were measured with subjects lying supine and standing upright. The effect of posture on estimates of heritability and genetic covariance was investigated in full pedigrees. Linkage was conducted on 196 candidate genes by sib-pair analyses, and empirical estimates of significance were obtained. A permutation algorithm was implemented to study the postural effect on linkage. ADRA1A, APO, CAST, CORIN, CRHR1, EDNRB, FGF2, GC, GJA1, KCNB2, MMP3, NPY, NR3C2, PLN, TGFBR2, TNFRSF6, and TRHR showed evidence of linkage with any phenotype in the supine position and not upon standing, whereas AKR1B1, CD36, EDNRA, F5, MMP9, PKD2, PON1, PPARG, PPARGC1A, PRKCA, and RET were specifically linked to standing phenotypes. Genetic profiling was undertaken to show genetic interactions among intermediate BP phenotypes and genes specific to each posture. When investigators perform genetic studies exclusively on a single posture, important genetic components of BP are missed. Supine and standing BPs have distinct genetic signatures. Standardized maneuvers influence the results of genetic investigations into BP, thus reflecting its dynamic regulation.'

aS'Neuroanatomical models hypothesize a role for the dorsal auditory pathway in phonological processing as a feedforward efferent system (Davis and Johnsrude, 2007; Rauschecker and Scott, 2009; Hickok et al., 2011). But the functional organization of the pathway, in terms of time course of interactions between auditory, somatosensory, and motor regions, and the hemispheric lateralization pattern is largely unknown. Here, ambiguous duplex syllables, with elements presented dichotically at varying interaural asynchronies, were used to parametrically modulate phonological processing and associated neural activity in the human dorsal auditory stream. Subjects performed syllable and chirp identification tasks, while event-related potentials and functional magnetic resonance images were concurrently collected. Joint independent component analysis was applied to fuse the neuroimaging data and study the neural dynamics of brain regions involved in phonological processing with high spatiotemporal resolution. Results revealed a highly interactive neural network associated with phonological processing, composed of functional fields in posterior temporal gyrus (pSTG), inferior parietal lobule (IPL), and ventral central sulcus (vCS) that were engaged early and almost simultaneously (at 80-100 ms), consistent with a direct influence of articulatory somatomotor areas on phonemic perception. Left hemispheric lateralization was observed 250 ms earlier in IPL and vCS than pSTG, suggesting that functional specialization of somatomotor (and not auditory) areas determined lateralization in the dorsal auditory pathway. The temporal dynamics of the dorsal auditory pathway described here offer a new understanding of its functional organization and demonstrate that temporal information is essential to resolve neural circuits underlying complex behaviors.'

aS'It has long been known that survival of preterm infants strongly depends upon birth weight and gestational age. This study addresses a different question - whether the gestational maturity improves neurodevelopmental outcomes for ventilated infants born at 23-28 weeks who survive to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) discharge.We performed a prospective cohort study of 199 ventilated infants born between 23 and 28 weeks of gestation. Neurodevelopmental impairment was determined using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development-II at 24 months.As expected, when considered as a ratio of all births, both survival and survival without neurodevelopmental impairment were strongly dependent on gestational age. However, the percentage of surviving infants who displayed neurodevelopmental impairment did not vary with gestational age for any level of neurodevelopmental impairment (MDI or PDI <50, <60, <70). Moreover, as a higher percentage of ventilated infants survived to NICU discharge at higher gestational ages, but the percentage of neurodevelopmental impairment in NICU survivors was unaffected by gestational age, the percentage of all ventilated births who survived with neurodevelopmental impairment rose - not fell - with increasing gestation age.For physicians, parents and policy-makers whose primary concern is the presence of neurodevelopmental impairment in infants who survive the NICU, reliance on gestational age appears to be misplaced.'

aS"According to an influential view of conceptual representation, action concepts are understood through motoric simulations, involving motor networks of the brain. A stronger version of this embodied account suggests that even figurative uses of action words (e.g., grasping the concept) are understood through motoric simulations. We investigated these claims by assessing whether Parkinson's disease (PD), a disorder affecting the motor system, is associated with selective deficits in comprehending action-related sentences. Twenty PD patients and 21 age-matched controls performed a sentence comprehension task, where sentences belonged to one of four conditions: literal action, non-idiomatic metaphoric action, idiomatic action, and abstract. The same verbs (referring to hand/arm actions) were used in the three action-related conditions. Patients, but not controls, were slower to respond to literal and idiomatic action than to abstract sentences. These results indicate that sensory-motor systems play a functional role in semantic processing, including processing of figurative action language."

aS"Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotypes are associated with variable risk of developing late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), with APOE epsilon 4 (APOE \xce\xb54) having higher risk. A variable poly-T length polymorphism at rs10524523, within intron 6 of the translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOMM40) gene, has been shown to influence age of onset in LOAD, with very long (VL) poly-T length associated with earlier disease onset, and short poly-T length associated with later onset. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that brain and cognitive changes suggestive of presymptomatic LOAD may be associated with this TOMM40 polymorphism.Among healthy APOE \xce\xb53 homozygous adults (N = 117; mean age, 55 years), we compared those who were homozygous for VL/VL (n = 35) TOMM40 poly-T lengths (who were presumably at higher risk) with those homozygous for short (S/S; n = 38) poly-T lengths, as well as those with heterozygous (S/VL; n = 44) poly-T length polymorphisms, on measures of learning and memory and on structural brain imaging.The VL/VL group showed lower performance than the S/S TOMM40 group on primacy retrieval from a verbal list learning task, a finding which is also seen in early Alzheimer's disease. A dose-dependent increase in the VL TOMM40 polymorphism (from no VL alleles, to S/VL heterozygous, to VL/VL homozygous) was associated with decreasing gray matter volume in the ventral posterior cingulate and medial ventral precuneus, a region of the brain affected early in LOAD.These findings among APOE \xce\xb53/\xce\xb53 late middle-aged adults suggest that a subgroup with VL TOMM40 poly-T lengths may be experiencing incipient LOAD-related cognitive and brain changes."

aS'Cardiac vagal control (CVC), an index of parasympathetic contribution to cardiac regulation, has been linked to enhanced executive functioning (EF). However, findings to date have been based on small or unique samples. Additionally, previous studies assessed the CVC-EF link only during rest or recovery period from a cognitive challenge, but not during both states. In the present study, data on 817 socioeconomically diverse participants were obtained from the Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS) study. As part of this study, participants completed cognitive tests, including EF, along with laboratory-based measures of CVC during rest and following recovery from a cognitive challenge. Regression analyses adjusting for respiratory rate revealed no effect of CVC at rest or during recovery on a global index of EF. However, exploratory post-hoc analyses of the components of the global EF index revealed a significant association between faster vagal recovery and better attention-switching and response inhibition abilities, as indexed by faster reaction time to the mixed SGST. This association remained significant after controlling for demographic, clinical (BMI, diseases and medications altering cardiac autonomic functioning, etc.), and health behavior covariates (Beta = .148, p = .010). Our findings suggest that future studies may need to investigate the links of CVC to specific EF abilities, rather than global measures of EF. Additionally, our results highlight the importance of assessing CVC during both rest and recovery from a cognitive challenge. The authors discuss the putative neurobiological underpinning of this link, as well as suggestions for future basic and clinical research.'

aS'The relationship of the structural integrity of white matter tracts and cortical activity to motor functional outcomes in stroke patients is of particular interest in understanding mechanisms of brain structural and functional changes while recovering from stroke. This study aims to probe these underlying mechanisms using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and fMRI measures. We examined the structural integrity of the posterior limb of the internal capsule (PLIC) using DTI and corticomotor activity using motor-task fMRI in stroke patients who completed up to 15 sessions of rehabilitation therapy using Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology. We hypothesized that (1) the structural integrity of PLIC and corticomotor activity are affected by stroke; (2) changes in structural integrity and corticomotor activity following BCI intervention are related to motor recovery; (3) there is a potential relationship between structural integrity and corticomotor activity. We found that (1) the ipsilesional PLIC showed significantly decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) values when compared to the contralesional PLIC; (2) lower ipsilesional PLIC-FA values were significantly associated with worse motor outcomes (i.e., ipsilesional PLIC-FA and motor outcomes were positively correlated.); (3) lower ipsilesional PLIC-FA values were significantly associated with greater ipsilesional corticomotor activity during impaired-finger-tapping-task fMRI (i.e., ipsilesional PLIC-FA and ipsilesional corticomotor activity were negatively correlated), with an overall bilateral pattern of corticomotor activity observed; and (4) baseline FA values predicted motor recovery assessed after BCI intervention. These findings suggest that (1) greater vs. lesser microstructural integrity of the ipsilesional PLIC may contribute toward better vs. poor motor recovery respectively in the stroke-affected limb and demand lesser vs. greater cortical activity respectively from the ipsilesional motor cortex; and that (2) PLIC-FA is a promising biomarker in tracking and predicting motor functional recovery in stroke patients receiving BCI intervention.'

aS'The nucleotide sequence diversity present among hepatitis C virus (HCV) isolates allows rapid adjustment to exterior forces including host immunity and drug therapy. This viral response reflects a combination of a high rate of replication together with an error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, providing for the selection and proliferation of the viruses with the highest fitness. We examined HCV subtype 1a whole-genome sequences to identify positions contributing to genotypic and phenotypic diversity. Phylogenetic tree reconstructions showed two distinct clades existing within the 1a subtype with each clade having a star-like tree topology and lacking definite correlation between time or place of isolation and phylogeny. Identification of significant phylogenetically informative sites at the nucleotide level revealed positions not only contributing to clade differentiation, but which are located at or proximal to codons associated with resistance to protease inhibitors (NS3 Q41) or polymerase inhibitors (NS5B S368). Synonymous/nonsynonymous substitution mutation analyses revealed that the majority of nucleotide mutations yielded synonymous amino acids, indicating the presence of purifying selection pressure across the polyprotein with pockets of positive selection also being detected. Despite evidence for divergence at several loci, certain 1a characteristics were preserved including the length of the alternative reading frame/F protein (ARF/F) gene, and a subtype 1a-specific phosphorylation site in NS5A (S349). Our analysis suggests that there may be strain-specific differences in the development of antiviral resistance to viruses infecting patients who are dependent on the genetic variation separating these two clades.'

aS"Snowflake Vitreoretinal Degeneration (SVD) is associated with the R162W mutation of the Kir7.1 inwardly-rectifying potassium channel. Kir7.1 is found at the apical membrane of Retinal Pigment Epithelial (RPE) cells, adjacent to the photoreceptor neurons. The SVD phenotype ranges from RPE degeneration to an abnormal b-wave to a liquid vitreous. We sought to determine how this mutation alters the structure and function of the human Kir7.1 channel. In this study, we expressed a Kir7.1 construct with the R162W mutation in CHO cells to evaluate function of the ion channel. Compared to the wild-type protein, the mutant protein exhibited a non-functional Kir channel that resulted in depolarization of the resting membrane potential. Upon co-expression with wild-type Kir7.1, R162W mutant showed a reduction of IKir7.1 and positive shift in '0' current potential. Homology modeling based on the structure of a bacterial Kir channel protein suggested that the effect of R162W mutation is a result of loss of hydrogen bonding by the regulatory lipid binding domain of the cytoplasmic structure."

aS'Although respiratory complications are a major cause of morbidity/mortality in many neural injuries or diseases, little is known concerning mechanisms whereby deficient myelin impairs breathing, or how patients compensate for such changes. Here, we tested the hypothesis that respiratory and forelimb motor functions are impaired in a rat model of focal dorsolateral spinal demyelination (ethidium bromide, EB). Ventilation, phrenic nerve activity and horizontal ladder walking were performed 7-14 days post-C2 injection of EB or vehicle (SHAM). EB caused dorsolateral demyelination at C2-C3 followed by significant spontaneous remyelination at 14 days post-EB. Although ventilation did not differ between groups, ipsilateral integrated phrenic nerve burst amplitude was significantly reduced versus SHAM during chemoreceptor activation at 7 days post-EB but recovered by 14 days. The ratio of ipsi- to contralateral phrenic nerve amplitude correlated with cross-sectional lesion area. This ratio was significantly reduced 7 days post-EB versus SHAM during baseline conditions, and versus SHAM and 14-day groups during chemoreceptor activation. Limb function ipsilateral to EB was impaired 7 days post-EB and partially recovered by 14 days post-EB. EB provides a reversible model of focal, spinal demyelination, and may be a useful model to study mechanisms of functional impairment and recovery via motor plasticity, or the efficacy of new therapeutic interventions to reduce severity or duration of disease.'

aS"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be a useful adjunct to current methods of evaluating renal function. MRI is a noninvasive imaging modality that has the ability to evaluate the kidneys regionally, which is lacking in current clinical methods. Other investigators have evaluated renal function with MRI-based measurements, such as with techniques to measure cortical and medullary perfusion, oxygen bioavailability and total renal blood flow (TRBF). However, use of all three techniques simultaneously, and therefore the relationships between these MRI-derived functional parameters, have not been reported previously.To evaluate the ability of these MRI techniques to track changes in renal function, we scanned 11 swine during a state of hyperperfusion with acetylcholine and a saline bolus and subsequently scanned during a state of hypoperfusion with the prolonged use of isoflurane anesthesia. For each time point, measurements of perfusion, oxygen bioavailability and TRBF were acquired. Measurements of perfusion and oxygen bioavailability were compared with measurements of TRBF for all swine across all time points.Cortical perfusion, cortical oxygen bioavailability, medullary oxygen bioavailability and TRBF significantly increased with the acetylcholine challenge. Cortical perfusion, medullary perfusion, cortical oxygen bioavailability and TRBF significantly decreased during isoflurane anesthesia. Cortical perfusion (Spearman's correlation coefficient = 0.68; P < 1 \xc3\x97 10(-6)) and oxygen bioavailability (Spearman's correlation coefficient = -0.60; P < 0.0001) correlated significantly with TRBF, whereas medullary perfusion and oxygen bioavailability did not correlate with TRBF.Our results demonstrate expected changes given the pharmacologically induced changes in renal function. Maintenance of the medullary oxygen bioavailability in low blood flow states may reflect the autoregulation particular to this region of the kidney. The ability to non-invasively measure all three parameters of kidney function in a single MRI examination and to evaluate the relationships between these functional parameters is potentially useful for evaluating the state of the human kidneys in situ in future studies."

aS"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a central regulator of tumor progression in a variety of human cancers. Cetuximab is an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody that has been approved for head and neck and colorectal cancer treatment, but many patients treated with cetuximab don't respond or eventually acquire resistance. To determine how tumor cells acquire resistance to cetuximab, we previously developed a model of acquired resistance using the non-small cell lung cancer line NCI-H226. These cetuximab-resistant (Ctx(R)) cells exhibit increased steady-state EGFR expression secondary to alterations in EGFR trafficking and degradation and, further, retained dependence on EGFR signaling for enhanced growth potential. Here, we examined Sym004, a novel mixture of antibodies directed against distinct epitopes on the extracellular domain of EGFR, as an alternative therapy for Ctx(R) tumor cells. Sym004 treatment of Ctx(R) clones resulted in rapid EGFR degradation, followed by robust inhibition of cell proliferation and down-regulation of several mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. To determine whether Sym004 could have therapeutic benefit in vivo, we established de novo Ctx(R) NCI-H226 mouse xenografts and subsequently treated Ctx(R) tumors with Sym004. Sym004 treatment of mice harboring Ctx(R) tumors resulted in growth delay compared to mice continued on cetuximab. Levels of total and phospho-EGFR were robustly decreased in Ctx(R) tumors treated with Sym004. Immunohistochemical analysis of these Sym004-treated xenograft tumors further demonstrated decreased expression of Ki67, and phospho-rpS6, as well as a modest increase in cleaved caspase-3. These results indicate that Sym004 may be an effective targeted therapy for Ctx(R) tumors."

aS'Gastrointestinal foreign bodies are commonly encountered; however, little knowledge exists as to the causes of foreign body ingestions and why they occur repeatedly in some patients.To identify and define patients at high risk for recurrent foreign body ingestion.A retrospective chart review of foreign body ingestion was conducted at a tertiary care medical centre over an 11-year period. Variables analyzed included age, sex, incarceration status, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV diagnosis, success of endoscopy, type of sedation used, method of extraction, complications, presence of gastrointestinal pathology, and incidence of recurrent food impaction or foreign body.A total of 159 patients with a foreign body ingestion were identified. One hundred fourteen (77%) experienced a single episode of ingestion and 45 (23%) experienced multiple ingestions. Of the patients with multiple ingestions, 27 (60%) had recurrent food impactions while 18 (40%) ingested foreign objects. In the recurrent ingestor group, a psychiatric disorder had been diagnosed in 16 patients (35.6%) and there were 13 incarcerated individuals (28.9%). The average number of recurrences was 2.6 per patient (117 total recurrences). Individuals with a psychiatric disorder experienced 3.9 recurrences per patient, while prisoners averaged 4.1 recurrences per patient. The combination of a psychiatric disorder and being incarcerated was associated with the highest recurrence rate (4.33 per patient). Multivariable logistic regression revealed that male sex (OR 2.9; P=0.022), being incarcerated (OR 3.0; P=0.024) and the presence of a psychiatric disorder (OR 2.5; P=0.03) were risk factors for recurrent ingestion.Risk factors for recurrent ingestion of foreign bodies were male sex, being incarcerated and the presence of a psychiatric disorder.'

aS"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers T-Tau and A\xce\xb2(42) are linked with Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet little is known about the relationship between CSF biomarkers and structural brain alteration in healthy adults. In this study we examined the extent to which AD biomarkers measured in CSF predict brain microstructure indexed by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and volume indexed by T1-weighted imaging. Forty-three middle-aged adults with parental family history of AD received baseline lumbar puncture and MRI approximately 3.5 years later. Voxel-wise image analysis methods were used to test whether baseline CSF A\xce\xb2(42), total tau (T-Tau), phosphorylated tau (P-Tau) and neurofilament light protein predicted brain microstructure as indexed by DTI and gray matter volume indexed by T1-weighted imaging. T-Tau and T-Tau/A\xce\xb2(42) were widely correlated with indices of brain microstructure (mean, axial, and radial diffusivity), notably in white matter regions adjacent to gray matter structures affected in the earliest stages of AD. None of the CSF biomarkers were related to gray matter volume. Elevated P-Tau and P-Tau/A\xce\xb2(42) levels were associated with lower recognition performance on the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test. Overall, the results suggest that CSF biomarkers are related to brain microstructure in healthy adults with elevated risk of developing AD. Furthermore, the results clearly suggest that early pathological changes in AD can be detected with DTI and occur not only in cortex, but also in white matter."

aS'Aeroallergen sensitization and virus-induced wheezing are risk factors for asthma development during early childhood, but the temporal developmental sequence between them is incompletely understood.To define the developmental relationship between aeroallergen sensitization and virus-induced wheezing.A total of 285 children at high risk for allergic disease and asthma were followed prospectively from birth. The timing and etiology of viral respiratory wheezing illnesses were determined, and aeroallergen sensitization was assessed annually for the first 6 years of life. The relationships between these events were assessed using a longitudinal multistate Markov model.Children who were sensitized to aeroallergens had greater risk of developing viral wheeze than nonsensitized children (hazard ratio [HR], 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-3.1). Allergic sensitization led to an increased risk of wheezing illnesses caused by human rhinovirus (HRV) but not respiratory syncytial virus. The absolute risk of sensitized children developing viral wheeze was greatest at 1 year of age; however, the relative risk was consistently increased at every age assessed. In contrast, viral wheeze did not lead to increased risk of subsequent allergic sensitization (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.50-1.1).Prospective, repeated characterization of a birth cohort demonstrated that allergic sensitization precedes HRV wheezing and that the converse is not true. This sequential relationship and the plausible mechanisms by which allergic sensitization can lead to more severe HRV-induced lower respiratory illnesses support a causal role for allergic sensitization in this developmental pathway. Therefore, therapeutics aimed at preventing allergic sensitization may modify virus-induced wheezing and the development of asthma.'

aS'Double censoring often occurs in registry studies when left censoring is present in addition to right censoring. In this work, we propose a new analysis strategy for such doubly censored data by adopting a quantile regression model. We develop computationally simple estimation and inference procedures by appropriately using the embedded martingale structure. Asymptotic properties, including the uniform consistency and weak convergence, are established for the resulting estimators. Moreover, we propose conditional inference to address the special identifiability issues attached to the double censoring setting. We further show that the proposed method can be readily adapted to handle left truncation. Simulation studies demonstrate good finite-sample performance of the new inferential procedures. The practical utility of our method is illustrated by an analysis of the onset of the most commonly investigated respiratory infection, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in children with cystic fibrosis through the use of the U.S. Cystic Fibrosis Registry.'

aS'To investigate the effect of age on heart rate recovery (HRR) from cognitive challenge.Aging is an independent risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease. HRR from exercise is an established predictor of cardiac morbidity and mortality, and evidence suggests that HRR from cognitive challenge is predictive of cardiac morbidity as well. Aging is associated with delayed HRR from exercise stress, but little is known about the effect of aging on HRR from psychological stress. We tested the hypothesis that age would be related to delayed HRR from psychological stress.HRR post exposure to cognitive challenge (mental arithmetic and Stroop) was investigated in a sample of 436 participants aged 35 to 84 years in MIDUS II, a national study of health and well-being. HRR was measured as 1) the amount of change from the stress level; 2) time to recover; and 3) the area under the curve. The analyses were controlled for medical comorbidities and medications that influence HR, such as body mass index, smoking, sex, menopausal status, and amount of physical activity/exercise.There was no effect for age on HRR as evaluated by all three recovery assessment methods.Contrary to expectation and in contrast to findings concerning HRR from exercise, HRR from cognitive challenge was preserved with age. These findings require further inquiry into differential mechanism(s) underlying HRR from psychological versus exercise stress, including any role for improved emotion regulation with greater age.'

aS'Bipolar disorder is associated with substance use and misuse. However, to date few studies have examined the relationship between hypomania and substance misuse and dependence in the general population.Data come from the National Institute of Mental Health Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys (CPES), a set of multi-stage area probability samples of US adults (N=10,404). Multivariable linear and logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between DSM-IV hypomania and nicotine, alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, and prescription drug use. Models were adjusted for age, gender, education, and marital status. Stratified analyses and interaction terms were used to determine whether the relationship between hypomania and substance misuse varied by race/ethnicity.The 12-month prevalence of hypomania was 0.5%. Hypomania was more common among African Americans (0.9%) relative to non-Hispanic Whites (0.5%) or other race/ethnicities (0.7%). Individuals with hypomania were 3.6 (95% CI: 1.5, 8.5) and 2.9 (95% CI: 1.3, 6.8) times more likely to also meet criteria for alcohol abuse/dependence and drug abuse/dependence relative to individuals without. The relationship between hypomania and substance use outcomes did not vary by race/ethnicity.The primary limitation of this study is its cross-sectional design, which precludes any inference about the causal nature of comorbid hypomania-substance use.Hypomania is associated with increased likelihood of substance use and dependence/abuse across a broad range of substances. These associations were consistent across racial/ethnic groups. Findings indicate that even sub-syndromal conditions, such as hypomania, are significantly related to substance use and misuse in the community.'

aS'Recent investigations have reported an association between depression and geriatric syndromes associated with low body mass, including frailty and osteoporosis. The objective of this study was to explore the relationship between depression and body composition among older adults.Data were from a case-cohort study (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8998) of adults aged 60 and older nested within the Baltimore Epidemiologic Catchment Area (ECA) Study. Lifetime depression syndrome was assessed using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS). Body composition (total and central lean and fat mass) was assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). The association between depression and body composition was evaluated using linear regression with bootstrap standard errors.Overall, there was no association between depression and total fat or total lean body mass. Among women, depression was associated with reduced central fat (B\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89-3.6\xe2\x80\x89kg, p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.06) and lean (B\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89-3.3\xe2\x80\x89kg, p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.04) mass adjusting for age, race, smoking status, and physical activity. Depression was unrelated to total or central fat or lean mass among men.Depression is associated with significantly lower central fat and lean mass among older women. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that depression and frailty are interrelated in later life, particularly among women.'

aS'In an effort to understand how environmental experiences contribute to risk for major depression (MD), we conducted joint autobiographical interviews with 14 pairs of monozygotic twins (mean age 51.2) rigorously discordant for a lifetime history of MD. Twelve of the pairs could be sorted into four broad categories. In two pairs, discordance was associated with a single traumatic event occurring to the affected twin. In seven pairs, the well twin had one stable, long-term, successful romantic relationship, whereas the affected co-twin had romantic reversals one or more of which precipitated depressive episodes. These pairs varied in the degree to which the romantic problems seemed to arise from bad luck or poor choices. In one pair, occupational difficulties were strongly related to discordance in experiences with MD. In two pairs, several mechanisms seemed to be at work. Discordance in the quality of intimate love relationships was the most common etiological factor revealed by interview in these discordant pairs, with single dramatic events and occupational problems being considerably rarer. Even in this best of natural experiments, the causal interrelationship between personality, environment and depressive episodes was not always clear. Many pairs illustrated the protective effects of planfulness and the malignant effect of cumulative continuity where early difficulties in relationships shaped the subsequent life course. These results speak both to the importance of environmental influences on human well-being and psychopathology, and the complexity of the causal paths underlying their effects.'

aS'This study sought to clarify whether pain-related catastrophizing is a response that varies given a specific situational circumstance (state) or an enduring personality construct (trait).We conducted a cohort study of 150 patients undergoing total knee arthroscopy at 2 hospitals. Patients completed a battery of psychological measures, provided various sociodemographic data, and were followed for 6 months. We hypothesized that associated total knee arthroscopy surgery and recovery would predict future catastrophizing severity.After controlling for baseline covariates of age, sex, ethnicity, depression, and anxiety, we found that current pain sensation intensity predicted future catastrophizing severity. Change in pain intensity was associated with the change in catastrophizing for the baseline to 6 months postsurgery, but not between the baseline to 2 months postsurgery.These data provide preliminary support for the notion that pain-related catastrophizing is a dynamic construct that is related to pain intensity.'

aS'Medullipin has been proposed to be an antihypertensive lipid hormone released from the renal medulla in response to increased arterial pressure and renal medullary blood flow. Because anandamide (AEA) possesses characteristics of this purported hormone, the present study tested the hypothesis that AEA or one of its metabolites represents medullipin. AEA was demonstrated to be enriched in the kidney medulla compared with cortex. Western blotting and enzymatic analyses of renal cortical and medullary microsomes revealed opposite patterns of enrichment of two AEA-metabolizing enzymes, with fatty acid amide hydrolase higher in the renal cortex and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) higher in the renal medulla. In COX-2 reactions with renal medullary microsomes, prostamide E2, the ethanolamide of prostaglandin E\xe2\x82\x82, was the major product detected. Intramedullarily infused AEA dose-dependently increased urine volume and sodium and potassium excretion (15-60 nmol/kg/min) but had little effect on mean arterial pressure (MAP). The renal excretory effects of AEA were blocked by intravenous infusion of celecoxib (0.1 \xce\xbcg/kg/min), a selective COX-2 inhibitor, suggesting the involvement of a prostamide intermediate. Plasma kinetic analysis revealed longer elimination half-lives for AEA and prostamide E2 compared with prostaglandin E\xe2\x82\x82. Intravenous prostamide E2 reduced MAP and increased renal blood flow (RBF), actions opposite to those of angiotensin II. Coinfusion of prostamide E2 inhibited angiotensin II effects on MAP and RBF. These results suggest that AEA and/or its prostamide metabolites in the renal medulla may represent medullipin and function as a regulator of body fluid and MAP.'

aS'To determine if the incidence of vestibular neuronitis displays seasonal variation.A retrospective case review was performed to determine the monthly and quarterly incidence of vestibular neuronitis over a 36-month period. Incidence values were compiled, and the chi-square test and Rayleigh test for circular means were used to assess for uneven distribution and seasonality, respectively.Fifty-two patients were diagnosed with vestibular neuronitis during the study period. The 2009-2010 study year showed uneven distribution and evidence of seasonality (R = 7.211, p < 0.001). However, the other two study years did not show statistical significance using either the chi-square test or Rayleigh test. In addition, when incidence values were aggregated across all three years of the study, neither the chi-square test nor Rayleigh test showed statistical significance.The present study found minimal evidence of seasonality in the incidence of vestibular neuronitis. These findings are consistent with studies of seasonality observed for other inner-ear disorders thought to be virally mediated.'

aS'Covert hepatic encephalopathy (CHE) impairs quality of life (QOL) and can be difficult to diagnose. Patient-administered methods that do not require specialized tests or equipment might increase rates of detection. We performed a longitudinal study to determine whether demographic data and responses to a validated QOL questionnaire, the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP), can identify patients with CHE.Patients with cirrhosis without prior overt HE were recruited from outpatient liver clinics at the Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center, from August 2008 through February 2012. We performed cognitive tests on 170 patients (mean age, 55 y; mean model for end-stage liver disease score, 9; 50% with hepatitis C-associated and 11% with alcohol-associated cirrhosis). Patients also were given the SIP questionnaire (136 questions on 12 QOL topics, requiring a yes or no answer) at enrollment, at 6 months, and at 12 months. The proportion of patients that responded "yes" to each question was compared between those with and without CHE. Patient variables (noncognitive), demographics (age, education, sex, alcoholic etiology), and SIP questions that produced different responses between groups were analyzed by logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analyses.Based on cognitive test results, 93 patients (55%) had CHE when the study began. They had a higher proportion of "yes" responses to 54 questions on the SIP questionnaire, across all categories. We developed a formula to identify patients with CHE based on age, sex, and responses to 4 SIP questions (a SIP CHE score). Baseline SIP CHE scores greater than 0 identified patients with CHE with 80% sensitivity and 79% specificity. Of the 98 patients who returned for the 6-month evaluation, 50% had CHE (the SIP CHE identified these patients with 88% sensitivity). Of the 50 patients who returned for the 12-month evaluation, 32% had CHE (the SIP CHE score identified these patients with 81% sensitivity).We developed a system to identify patients with CHE based on age, sex, and responses to 4 SIP questions; this formula identified patients with CHE with more than 80% sensitivity over a 12-month period after the initial enrollment. Patient-administered CHE screening strategies that do not include specialized tests could increase the detection of CHE and improve therapy.'

aS'Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure is linked to developmental deficits and disorders with known cerebellar involvement. However, direct biological effects and underlying neurochemical mechanisms remain unclear.We sought to identify and evaluate underlying neurochemical change in the rat cerebellum with ETS exposure during critical period development.We exposed rats to daily ETS (300, 100, and 0 \xc2\xb5g/m3 total suspended particulate) from postnatal day 8 (PD8) to PD23 and then assayed the response at the behavioral, neuroproteomic, and cellular levels.Postnatal ETS exposure induced heightened locomotor response in a novel environment on par initially with amphetamine stimulation. The cerebellar mitochondrial subproteome was significantly perturbed in the ETS-exposed rats. Findings revealed a dose-dependent up-regulation of aerobic processes through the modification and increased translocation of Hk1 to the mitochondrion with corresponding heightened ATP synthase expression. ETS exposure also induced a dose-dependent increase in total Dnm1l mitochondrial fission factor; although more active membrane-bound Dnm1l was found at the lower dose. Dnm1l activation was associated with greater mitochondrial staining, particularly in the molecular layer, which was independent of stress-induced Bcl-2 family dynamics. Further, electron microscopy associated Dnm1l-mediated mitochondrial fission with increased biogenesis, rather than fragmentation.The critical postnatal period of cerebellar development is vulnerable to the effects of ETS exposure, resulting in altered behavior. The biological effect of ETS is underlain in part by a Dnm1l-mediated mitochondrial energetic response at a time of normally tight control. These findings represent a novel mechanism by which environmental exposure can impact neurodevelopment and function.'

aS'Polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA), also known as poly-N-acetyl-\xce\xb2-(1-6)-glucosamine (PIA/PNAG) is an important component of Staphylococcus aureus biofilms and also contributes to resistance to phagocytosis. The proteins IcaA, IcaD, IcaB, and IcaC are encoded within the intercellular adhesin (ica) operon and synthesize PIA/PNAG. We discovered a mechanism of phase variation in PIA/PNAG expression that appears to involve slipped-strand mispairing. The process is reversible and RecA-independent, and involves the expansion and contraction of a simple tetranucleotide tandem repeat within icaC. Inactivation of IcaC results in a PIA/PNAG-negative phenotype. A PIA/PNAG-hyperproducing strain gained a fitness advantage in vitro following the icaC mutation and loss of PIA/PNAG production. The mutation was also detected in two clinical isolates, suggesting that under certain conditions, loss of PIA/PNAG production may be advantageous during infection. There was also a survival advantage for an icaC-negative strain harboring intact icaADB genes relative to an isogenic icaADBC deletion mutant. Together, these results suggest that inactivation of icaC is a mode of phase variation for PIA/PNAG expression, that high-level production of PIA/PNAG carries a fitness cost, and that icaADB may contribute to bacterial fitness, by an unknown mechanism, in the absence of an intact icaC gene and PIA/PNAG production.'

aS"Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) remain ubiquitous environmental contaminants. Developmental exposures are suspected to impact reproduction. Analysis of mixtures of PCBs may be problematic as components have a complex correlation structure, and along with limited sample sizes, standard regression strategies are problematic. We compared the results of a novel, empirical method to those based on categorization of PCB compounds by (1) hypothesized biological activity previously proposed and widely applied, and (2) degree of ortho- substitution (mono, di, tri), in a study of the relation of maternal serum PCBs and daughter's time to pregnancy.We measured PCBs in maternal serum samples collected in the early postpartum in 289 daughters in the Child Health and Development Studies birth cohort. We queried time to pregnancy in these daughters 28-31 years later. We applied a novel weighted quantile sum approach to find the bad-actor compounds in the PCB mixture found in maternal serum. The approach includes empirical estimation of the weights through a bootstrap step which accounts for the variation in the estimated weights.Bootstrap analyses indicated the dominant functionality groups associated with longer TTP were the dioxin-like, anti-estrogenic group (average weight, 22%) and PCBs not previously classified by biological activity (54%). In contrast, the unclassified PCBs were not important in the association with shorter TTP, where the anti-estrogenic groups and the PB-inducers group played a more important role (60% and 23%, respectively). The highly chlorinated PCBs (average weight, 89%) were mostly associated with longer TTP; in contrast, the degree of chlorination was less discriminating for shorter TTP. Finally, PCB 56 was associated with the strongest relationship with TTP with a weight of 47%.Our empirical approach found some associations previously identified by two classification schemes, but also identified other bad actors. This empirical method can generate hypotheses about mixture effects and mechanisms and overcomes some of the limitations of standard regression techniques."

aS'The co-occurrence of suicidal ideation, depression, and conduct disturbance is likely explained in part by correlated genetic and environmental risk factors. Little is known about the specific nature of these associations. Structured interviews on 2,814 twins from the Virginia Twin Study of Adolescent Behavioral Development (VTSABD) and Young Adult Follow-Up (YAFU) yielded data on symptoms of depression, conduct disorder, and adolescent and young adult suicidal ideation. Univariate analyses revealed that the familial aggregation for each trait was explained by a combination of additive genetic and shared environmental effects. Suicidal ideation in adolescence was explained in part by genetic influences, but predominantly accounted for by environmental factors. A mixture of genetic and shared environmental influences explained ideation occurring in young adulthood. Multivariate analyses revealed that there are genetic and shared environmental effects common to suicidal ideation, depression, and conduct disorder. The association between adolescent suicidal ideation and CD was attributable to the same genetic and environmental risk factors for depression. These findings underscore that prevention and intervention strategies should reflect the different underlying mechanisms involving depression and conduct disorder to assist in identifying adolescents at suicidal risk.'

aS'In the present study we show that histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) enhance the anti-tumor effects of melanoma differentiation associated gene-7/interleukin 24 (mda- 7/IL-24) in human renal carcinoma cells. Similar data were obtained in other GU tumor cells. Combination of these two agents resulted in increased autophagy that was dependent on expression of ceramide synthase 6, with HDACIs enhancing MDA-7/IL-24 toxicity by increasing generation of ROS and Ca (2+). Knock down of CD95 protected cells from HDACI and MDA-7/IL-24 lethality. Sorafenib treatment further enhanced (HDACI + MDA-7/IL-24) lethality. Anoikis resistant renal carcinoma cells were more sensitive to MDA-7/IL-24 that correlated with elevated SRC activity and tyrosine phosphorylation of CD95. We employed a recently constructed serotype 5/3 adenovirus, which is more effective than a serotype 5 virus in delivering mda- 7/IL-24 to renal carcinoma cells and which conditionally replicates (CR) in tumor cells expressing MDA-7/IL-24 by virtue of placing the adenoviral E1A gene under the control of the cancer-specific promoter progression elevated gene-3 (Ad.5/3-PEG-E1A-mda-7; CRAd.5/3-mda-7, Ad.5/3-CTV), to define efficacy in renal carcinoma cells. Ad.5/3-CTV decreased the growth of renal carcinoma tumors to a significantly greater extent than did a non-replicative virus Ad.5/3-mda-7. In contralateral uninfected renal carcinoma tumors Ad.5/3-CTV also decreased the growth of tumors to a greater extent than did Ad.5/3-mda-7. In summation, our data demonstrates that HDACIs enhance MDA-7/IL-24-mediated toxicity and tumor specific adenoviral delivery and viral replication of mda-7/IL-24 is an effective pre-clinical renal carcinoma therapeutic.'

aS"Nod2 has been extensively characterized as a bacterial sensor that induces an antimicrobial and inflammatory gene expression program. Therefore, it is unclear why Nod2 mutations that disrupt bacterial recognition are paradoxically among the highest risk factors for Crohn's disease, which involves an exaggerated immune response directed at intestinal bacteria. Here, we identified several abnormalities in\xc2\xa0the small-intestinal epithelium of Nod2(-/-) mice including inflammatory gene expression and goblet cell dysfunction, which were associated with excess interferon-\xce\xb3 production by intraepithelial lymphocytes and Myd88 activity. Remarkably, these abnormalities were dependent on the expansion of a common member of the intestinal microbiota Bacteroides vulgatus, which also mediated exacerbated inflammation in Nod2(-/-) mice upon small-intestinal injury. These results indicate that Nod2 prevents inflammatory pathologies by controlling the microbiota and support a multihit disease model involving specific gene-microbe interactions."

aS'The promise of modern personalized medicine is to use molecular and clinical information to better diagnose, manage, and treat disease, on an individual patient basis. These functions are predominantly enabled by molecular signatures, which are computational models for predicting phenotypes and other responses of interest from high-throughput assay data. Data-analytics is a central component of molecular signature development and can jeopardize the entire process if conducted incorrectly. While exploratory data analysis may tolerate suboptimal protocols, clinical-grade molecular signatures are subject to vastly stricter requirements. Closing the gap between standards for exploratory versus clinically successful molecular signatures entails a thorough understanding of possible biases in the data analysis phase and developing strategies to avoid them.Using a recently introduced data-analytic protocol as a case study, we provide an in-depth examination of the poorly studied biases of the data-analytic protocols related to signature multiplicity, biomarker redundancy, data preprocessing, and validation of signature reproducibility. The methodology and results presented in this work are aimed at expanding the understanding of these data-analytic biases that affect development of clinically robust molecular signatures.Several recommendations follow from the current study. First, all molecular signatures of a phenotype should be extracted to the extent possible, in order to provide comprehensive and accurate grounds for understanding disease pathogenesis. Second, redundant genes should generally be removed from final signatures to facilitate reproducibility and decrease manufacturing costs. Third, data preprocessing procedures should be designed so as not to bias biomarker selection. Finally, molecular signatures developed and applied on different phenotypes and populations of patients should be treated with great caution.'

aS'Accelerated osteoclastic bone resorption plays a central role in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis and other bone diseases. Because identifying the molecular pathways that regulate osteoclast activity provides a key to understanding the causes of these diseases and developing new treatments, we studied the effect of adenosine A(1) receptor blockade or deletion on bone density.The bone mineral density (BMD) in adenosine A(1) receptor-knockout (A(1)R-knockout) mice was analyzed by dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanning, and the trabecular and cortical bone volume was determined by microfocal computed tomography (micro-CT). The mice were ovariectomized or sham-operated, and 5 weeks after surgery, when osteopenia had developed, several parameters were analyzed by DXA scanning and micro-CT. A histologic examination of bones obtained from A(1)R-knockout and wild-type mice was carried out. Visualization of osteoblast function (bone formation) after tetracycline double-labeling was performed by fluorescence microscopy.Micro-CT analysis of bones from A(1)R-knockout mice showed significantly increased bone volume. Electron microscopy of bones from A(1)R-knockout mice showed the absence of ruffled borders of osteoclasts and osteoclast bone resorption. Immunohistologic analysis demonstrated that although osteoclasts were present in the A(1)R-knockout mice, they were smaller and often not associated with bone. No morphologic changes in osteoblasts were observed, and bone-labeling studies revealed no change in the bone formation rates in A(1)R-knockout mice.These results suggest that the adenosine A(1) receptor may be a useful target in treating diseases characterized by excessive bone turnover, such as osteoporosis and prosthetic joint loosening.'

aS'There are multiple genetic links between schizophrenia and a deficit of proline dehydrogenase (PRODH) enzyme activity. However, reports testing for an association of schizophrenia with the resulting proline elevation have been conflicting. The objectives of this study were to investigate whether hyperprolinemia is associated with schizophrenia, and to measure the relationship between plasma proline, and clinical features and symptoms of schizophrenia. We performed a cross-sectional case-control study, comparing fasting plasma proline in 90 control subjects and 64 schizophrenic patients and testing for association of mild to moderate hyperprolinemia with schizophrenia. As secondary analyses, the relationship between hyperprolinemia and five measures of clinical onset, symptoms and outcome were investigated. Patients had significantly higher plasma proline than matched controls (p<0.0001), and categorical analysis of gender adjusted hyperprolinemia showed a significant association with schizophrenia (OR 6.15, p=0.0003). Hyperprolinemic patients were significantly older at their first hospitalization (p=0.015 following correction for multiple testing). While plasma proline level was not related to total, positive or negative symptoms, hyperprolinemic status had a significant effect on length of hospital stay (p=0.005), following adjustment for race, BPRS score, and cross-sectional time from admission to proline measurement. Mild to moderate hyperprolinemia is a significant risk factor for schizophrenia, and may represent an intermediate phenotype in the disease. Hyperprolinemic patients have a significantly later age of first psychiatric hospitalization, suggestive of later onset, and hospital stays 46% longer than non-hyperprolinemic subjects. These findings have implications in the etiology of schizophrenia, and for the clinical management of these patients.'

aS'Adenosine, acting at the A2A receptor, mediates the antiinflammatory effects of methotrexate (MTX) in models of inflammation. We previously reported that A2A receptor ligation diminishes wear particle-driven osteolysis. The aim of this study was to investigate whether MTX treatment could prevent bone resorption caused by inflammatory osteolysis.C57BL/6 mice (6-8 weeks old) received intraperitoneal injections of 1 mg/kg MTX (n = 20) or 0.9% saline (n = 10), starting 2 weeks prior to surgical implantation of 3 mg of wear particles (ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene [UHMWPE] particles). The MTX-treated mice received daily injections of vehicle or ZM241385 at the surgical site until they were killed, 14 days later. XenoLight RediJect Bone Probe 680 was injected intravenously, and fluorescence analysis of the calvaria using an IVIS imaging system was performed to assess bone formation. Micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and immunostaining for osteoclast and osteoblast markers were performed.Implantation of wear particles induced bone pitting and thinning, as shown by micro-CT. MTX treatment markedly reduced osteolysis, and this effect was abrogated by treatment with the A2A receptor antagonist ZM241385. Implantation of UHMWPE reduced new bone formation, and MTX treatment restored new bone formation, an effect that was completely reversed by treatment with ZM241385. Histologic examination of particle-exposed calvariae demonstrated that MTX prevented accumulation of an inflammatory infiltrate at the site of particle implantation, increased the number of osteoblasts, and reduced the number of osteoclasts at the site of inflammation, an effect that was reversed by treatment with ZM241385.MTX reduces inflammatory osteolysis indirectly via stimulation of A2A receptor and may represent a novel approach to enhance orthopedic implant survival, delaying or eliminating the need for revision arthroplasty surgery.'

aS"In the treatment of acetaminophen toxicity, clinicians believe that N-acetylcysteine (NAC) artificially elevates prothrombin time (PT). However, the effect of NAC on human blood coagulation remains unverified. In a previous study, we show that NAC had a dose-dependent effect on PT. To our knowledge, there are no studies that specifically examine the mechanism by which NAC affects PT. This study evaluates the effect from a therapeutic NAC dose on the activity of coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X in human plasma.We obtained blood samples from ten volunteer subjects. After centrifugation of each volunteer's blood sample, the plasma was pipetted and divided into two 1-mL aliquots. We used the first-1 mL sample as a control. The second 1-mL plasma sample had 5 \xce\xbcL of 20 % NAC, added to make a final concentration of 1,000 mg of NAC per L of plasma. This concentration of NAC approximates the plasma levels achieved after a 150-mg/kg dose. We incubated the two samples for each subject (control and 1,000 mg/L) at 37\xc2\xb0C for 1 h and measured the activity of coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X. We compared factor activity using the paired student t test.Participants included ten healthy subjects; six males, four females, median age 31 years. Mean values of the control samples for factors II, VII, IX, and X were 134 (CI 119-149), 126 (CI 90-163), 137 (CI 117-157), and 170 (CI 144-196)\xe2\x80\x89%, respectively. Mean values of the NAC-containing samples for factors II, VII, IX, and X were 90 (CI 79-100), 66 (CI 51-80), 74 (CI 63-85), and 81 (CI 71-90) %, respectively. All samples containing NAC had significantly lower coagulation factor activity level than their controls with a p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.001.In a previous study, we were able to demonstrate that NAC had a dose-dependent effect on PT. In this study, we compared activity of factors II, VII, IX, and X at baseline and for samples that received NAC. All factor activity had a significant decrease with the addition of NAC. This fall in factor activity is not explained by the dilution of adding NAC to the test samples.We are able to demonstrate a significant decrease in the activity of coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X with the addition of NAC. This may be the mechanism by which PT increased in our previous study."

aS'Occupational exposure to nickel compounds has been associated with lung and nasal cancers. We have previously shown that exposure of the human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells to NiCl(2) for 24 hr significantly increased global levels of trimethylated H3K4 (H3K4me3), a transcriptional activating mark that maps to the promoters of transcribed genes. To further understand the potential epigenetic mechanism(s) underlying nickel carcinogenesis, we performed genome-wide mapping of H3K4me3 by chromatin immunoprecipitation and direct genome sequencing (ChIP-seq) and correlated with transcriptome genome-wide mapping of RNA transcripts by massive parallel sequencing of cDNA (RNA-seq). The effect of NiCl(2) treatment on H3K4me3 peaks within 5,000 bp of transcription start sites (TSSs) on a set of genes highly induced by nickel in both A549 cells and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were analyzed. Nickel exposure increased the level of H3K4 trimethylation in both the promoters and coding regions of several genes including CA9 and NDRG1 that were increased in expression in A549 cells. We have also compared the extent of the H3K4 trimethylation in the absence and presence of formaldehyde crosslinking and observed that crosslinking of chromatin was required to observe H3K4 trimethylation in the coding regions immediately downstream of TSSs of some nickel-induced genes including ADM and IGFBP3. This is the first genome-wide mapping of trimethylated H3K4 in the promoter and coding regions of genes induced after exposure to NiCl(2). This study may provide insights into the epigenetic mechanism(s) underlying the carcinogenicity of nickel compounds.'

aS'Despite the complexity of tuberculosis (TB) serology, antibodies (Abs) remain attractive biomarkers for TB. Recent evidence of a mycobacterial capsule that consists mainly of the polysaccharides arabinomannan (AM) and glucan provides new options for serologic targets. For this study, Ab responses to AM and glucan for 47 U.S. TB patients (33 HIV negative [HIV(-)], 14 HIV positive [HIV(+)]), 42 healthy controls, and 38 asymptomatic HIV(+) controls were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). The results were compared with Ab responses to the mycobacterial glycolipid cell wall antigen lipoarabinomannan (LAM) and to the proteins malate synthase (MS) and MPT51. We found that the main immunoglobulin (Ig) isotype response to polysaccharides was IgG, predominantly of subclass IgG2. IgG responses to AM were significantly higher for HIV(-) and HIV(+) TB cases than for controls (P, <0.0001 and <0.01, respectively); significantly higher for HIV(-) than for HIV(+) TB cases (P, <0.01); and significantly higher in sputum smear-positive than smear-negative patients in both HIV(-) and HIV(+) cases (P, 0.01 and 0.02, respectively). In both TB groups, titers of Ab to glucan were significantly lower than titers of Ab to AM (P, <0.0001). IgG responses to AM and MS or to AM and MPT51 did not correlate with each other in HIV(-) TB patients, while they correlated significantly in HIV(+) TB patients (P, 0.01 and 0.05, respectively). We conclude that Ab responses to AM could contribute to the serodiagnosis of TB, especially for HIV(-) TB patients. This study also provides new and important insights into the differences in the profiles of Abs to mycobacterial antigens between HIV(-) and HIV(+) TB patients.'

aS'Lymphocyte homing, which contributes to inflammation, has been studied extensively in the small intestine, but there is little known about homing to the large intestine, the site most commonly affected in inflammatory bowel disease. GPR15, an orphan heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptor, controlled the specific homing of T cells, particularly FOXP3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs), to the large intestine lamina propria (LILP). GPR15 expression was modulated by gut microbiota and transforming growth factor-\xce\xb21, but not by retinoic acid. GPR15-deficient mice were prone to develop more severe large intestine inflammation, which was rescued by the transfer of GPR15-sufficient Tregs. Our findings thus describe a T cell-homing receptor for LILP and indicate that GPR15 plays a role in mucosal immune tolerance largely by regulating the influx of Tregs.'

aS'The BRAF V600E (BRAF+) mutation activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathway and may confer an aggressive phenotype in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). Clinically, the behavior of BRAF+ PTC, however, varies from an indolent to an aggressive course. SPRY2 is a negative feedback regulator of the MAPK/ERK pathway. We hypothesize that the level of SPRY2 expression contributes to MAPK/ERK pathway output and accounts for BRAF+ and clinical heterogeneity.A tissue microarray with BRAF-positive PTCs (BRAF+ PTCs) was constructed and analyzed for SPRY2 expression and MAPK/ERK output. Data were studied in the context of clinicopathologic factors to develop a risk stratification system predictive of tumor biology. SPRY2 function was studied by silencing SPRY2 in BRAF+ PTC cells. These cells were treated with MAPK/ERK pathway inhibitors and assessed for growth effects.BRAF+ PTCs with an intact MAPK/ERK feedback pathway do not exhibit lymph node metastases. BRAF+ PTCs with dysregulated feedback pathways have nodal metastasis. When SPRY2 is silenced, the BRAF+ PTC cells are significantly more sensitive to MAPK/ERK inhibition.PTC behavior likely is dependent on both the driver of the MAPK/ERK pathway and its regulatory feedback. When the feedback pathway is intact, the tumor phenotype seems to be less aggressive. This observation has direct and important clinical implications and may alter our treatment strategies.'

In addition, we assayed IL-17 secretion in response to the same stimuli, and found less subject-to-subject variation. Analysis of the ratio of IFN-\xce\xb3 to IL-17 secretion on a subject-to-subject basis also revealed a wide range, with the majority of results distributed in a narrow range, and a minority with extreme results all of which were greater than that in the majority of subjects. The data suggest that study of exceptional responses to M. tuberculosis antigens may reveal immunologic correlates with specific outcomes of M. tuberculosis infection.Variation of IFN\xce\xb3 and IFN-\xce\xb3/IL-17 responses to mycobacterial antigens exceeds that of responses to the polyclonal stimulus, PHA, in TST positive healthy humans. This indicates a quantitative spectrum of human immune responses to infection with M. tuberculosis. Since the outcome of human infection with M. tuberculosis varies greatly, systematic study of multiple immune responses to multiple antigens is likely to reveal correlations between selected immune responses and the outcomes of infection.'

aS'The retrovirus, human T-cell-lymphotrophic virus-1 (HTLV-I) is the etiologic agent of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) and the neurological disorder HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). The HTLV-I-encoded protein tax constitutively activates interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-9, and IL-15 autocrine/paracrine systems that in turn activate the Jak3 (Janus kinase 3)/STAT5 (signal transducers and activators of transcription 5) pathway, suggesting a therapeutic strategy that involves targeting Jak3. We evaluated the action of the Jak3 inhibitor CP-690,550 on cytokine dependent ex vivo proliferation that is characteristic of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from select patients with smoldering or chronic subtypes of ATL, or from those with HAM/TSP whose PBMCs are associated with autocrine/paracrine pathways that involve the production of IL-2, IL-9, IL-15, and their receptors. CP-690,550 at 50 nM inhibited the 6-day ex vivo spontaneous proliferation of PBMCs from ATL and HAM/TSP patients by 67.1% and 86.4%, respectively. Furthermore, CP-690,550 inhibited STAT5 phosphorylation in isolated ATL T cells ex vivo. Finally, in an in vivo test of biological activity, CP-690,550 treatment of mice with a CD8 T-cell IL-15-transgenic leukemia that manifests an autocrine IL-15/IL-15R\xce\xb1 pathway prolonged the survival duration of these tumor-bearing mice. These studies support further evaluation of the Jak3 inhibitor CP-690,550 in the treatment of select patients with HTLV-I-associated ATL and HAM/TSP.'

aS"A noninvasive microwave beamforming strategy is proposed for selective localized heating of biological tissue. The proposed technique is based on time multiplexing of multiple beamformers. We investigate the effectiveness of the time-multiplexed beamforming in the context of brain hyperthermia treatment by using a high-fidelity numerical head phantom of an adult female from the Virtual Family (IT'IS Foundation) as our testbed. An operating frequency of 1 GHz is considered to balance the improved treatment resolution afforded by higher frequencies against the increased penetration through the brain afforded by lower frequencies. The exact head geometry and dielectric properties of biological tissues in the head are assumed to be available for the creation of patient-specific propagation models used in beamformer design. Electromagnetic and thermal simulations based on the finite-difference time-domain method are used to evaluate the hyperthermia performance of time-multiplexed beamforming and conventional beamforming strategies. The proposed time-multiplexing technique is shown to reduce the unintended heating of healthy tissue without affecting the treatment temperature or volume. The efficacy of the method is demonstrated for target locations in three different regions of the brain. This approach has the potential to improve microwave-induced localized heating for cancer treatment via hyperthermia or heat-activated chemotherapeutic drug release."

aS'Sex differences exist in autonomic control of the cardiovascular system. This study was designed to directly test sex or female menstrual phase-related differences in \xce\xb1-adrenergic control of blood flow during exercise. We hypothesized that women would exhibit reduced \xce\xb1-adrenergic vasoconstriction compared with men during exercise; in addition, women would constrict less during the early luteal than the early follicular phase of the female menses. Young men (n = 10) were studied once and women (n = 9) studied twice, once during the early follicular phase and once during the early luteal phase of female menses. We measured forearm blood flow (FBF; Doppler ultrasound of the brachial artery) during rest and steady-state dynamic exercise (15 and 30% of maximal voluntary contraction, 20 contractions/min). A brachial artery catheter was inserted for the local administration of \xce\xb1-adrenergic agonists [phenylephrine (PE; \xce\xb1(1)) or clonidine (CL; \xce\xb1(2))]. Blood flow responses to exercise [forearm vascular conductance (FVC)] were similar between all groups. At rest, infusion of PE or CL decreased FVC in all groups (40-60% reduction). Vasoconstriction to PE was abolished in all groups at 15 and 30% exercise intensity. Vasoconstriction to CL was reduced at 15% and abolished at 30% intensity in all groups; women had less CL-induced constriction during the early luteal than early follicular phase (P < 0.017, 15% intensity). These results indicate that vasodilator responses to forearm exercise are comparable between men and women and are achieved through similar paths of \xce\xb1-adrenergic vascular control at moderate intensities; this control may differ at low intensities specific to the female menstrual phase.'

aS'Paediatric cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) is uncommon and inadequately described in the literature. Similar to adults, children with CLE develop LE-specific and/or LE-nonspecific skin findings. Similarities and differences in demographics and clinical course between paediatric and adult CLE have not been sufficiently described.To detail the demographic and clinical features of paediatric CLE and compare these findings with those reported in the adult literature.A retrospective chart review was performed of 53 children seen in a paediatric dermatology clinic with cutaneous manifestations of LE.Patients presented with all five major subtypes of CLE, with some notable differences from adult CLE and previously published reports of paediatric CLE. Progression from discoid LE to systemic LE (SLE) did not occur in our cohort. Patients with subacute CLE were more likely than adults to have lesions below the waist as well as concomitant SLE. Sex distribution for CLE in our study was equal prior to puberty and female predominant in post-pubertal patients.Children with CLE have variable clinical presentations and progression to SLE that may be different from adult disease. Specifically, children with acute and subacute CLE may be more likely than adults to have systemic disease; therefore, patients with these subtypes should be monitored closely for evidence of SLE. Study limitations included small patient numbers that may limit the ability to generalize these data and relatively short follow-up intervals.'

aS"The problem of how word meaning is processed in the brain has been a topic of intense investigation in cognitive neuroscience. While considerable correlational evidence exists for the involvement of sensory-motor systems in conceptual processing, it is still unclear whether they play a causal role. We investigated this issue by comparing the performance of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) with that of age-matched controls when processing action and abstract verbs. To examine the effects of task demands, we used tasks in which semantic demands were either implicit (lexical decision and priming) or explicit (semantic similarity judgment). In both tasks, PD patients' performance was selectively impaired for action verbs (relative to controls), indicating that the motor system plays a more central role in the processing of action verbs than in the processing of abstract verbs. These results argue for a causal role of sensory-motor systems in semantic processing."

aS'Diverticular disease is common in the outpatient setting; yet, rigorous study of diagnosis and management strategies is currently limited to hospitalized patients. Here, we characterize the clinical assessment generating the diagnostic label of diverticulitis in outpatients.Encounters for diverticulitis were identified using ICD-9 diagnosis codes (562.11/562.13) from the electronic medical record system of a tertiary referral hospital and its regional clinics. The frequencies of various demographic and clinical variables were compared between patients presenting in the emergency room (ER) or outpatient Clinic.Between 2003 and 2008, 820 inpatients and 2,576 outpatients met inclusion criteria (328 [13%] ER, 2,248 [87%] Clinic). Compared to ER patients, Clinic patients were less likely to undergo urgent abdominal/pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan (14% vs. 85%, p<.0001) or have an abnormal WBC count (35% vs. 69%, p<.0001). Twenty-four hour , including inpatient admission (30% ER vs. 3.5% Clinic, p<.0001) and colectomy (1.2% ER vs. 0.4% Clinic, p=0.08) were rare in both groups.Diverticulitis in the outpatient setting is often characterized by infrequent use of CT scans, lack of leukocytosis, and rare need for urgent surgery or early admission. As this diagnostic label appears to be commonly applied without objective evidence, further study is needed to evaluate its validity.'

aS"Examine factors that mediate parent-infant relationships 12 months after positive newborn screening (NBS).We examined effects of infant diagnosis, parents' perceptions of child vulnerability and child attachment, parental depression and anxiety on parent-infant feeding interactions for 131 mothers and 118 fathers of 131 infants whose NBS and diagnostics confirmed cystic fibrosis (CF, n = 23), congenital hypothyroidism (CH, n = 35), CF carrier status (CF-C, n = 38), or healthy normal NBS (H, n = 35).Separate composite indicator structural equation models for mothers and fathers showed that neonatal diagnosis was not associated with increased anxiety or depression. In comparison with the healthy group, CF group parents reported higher perceptions of child vulnerability (p < .001, p = .002), and CF-C group fathers viewed their children as more attached (p = .021). High maternal perception of child vulnerability was associated with low perceptions of child attachment (p = .001), which was associated with task-oriented feeding behavior (p = .016, p = .029). Parental task-oriented feeding behavior was associated with less positive (p < .001, p < .001) and more negative interactions (p < .001, p = .001) with their infants. High paternal perception of child vulnerability was associated with negative parent interactions (p < .001). High parental affective involvement and verbalization was associated with high infant affective expressiveness, communicative skills, and social responsiveness (mothers' p < .001, fathers' p < .001). High parental negative effect and/or inconsistent and intrusive behavior were associated with infant dysregulation and irritability (mothers, p < .001, fathers, p < .001).The severity of conditions identified through NBS can affect parents' perceptions of their child's vulnerability and attachment. Infant feeding problems in the context of chronic health conditions, like CF, could represent signs of more deeply rooted concerns regarding the parent-child relationship that merit additional clinical evaluation."

aS'Inactivating mutations of the "phosphate regulating gene with homologies to endopeptidases on the X chromosome" (PHEX/Phex) underlie disease in patients with X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) and the hyp-mouse, a murine homologue of the human disorder. Although increased serum fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) underlies the HYP phenotype, the mechanism(s) by which PHEX mutations inhibit FGF-23 degradation and/or enhance production remains unknown. Here we show that treatment of wild-type mice with the proprotein convertase (PC) inhibitor, decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethyl ketone (Dec), increases serum FGF-23 and produces the HYP phenotype. Because PC2 is uniquely colocalized with PHEX in osteoblasts/bone, we examined if PC2 regulates PHEX-dependent FGF-23 cleavage and production. Transfection of murine osteoblasts with PC2 and its chaperone protein 7B2 cleaved FGF-23, whereas Signe1 (7B2) RNA interference (RNAi) transfection, which limited 7B2 protein production, decreased FGF-23 degradation and increased Fgf-23 mRNA and protein. The mechanism by which decreased 7B2\xe2\x80\xa2PC2 activity influences Fgf-23 mRNA was linked to reduced conversion of the precursor to bone morphogenetic protein 1 (proBMP1) to active BMP1, which resulted in limited cleavage of dentin matrix acidic phosphoprotein 1 (DMP1), and consequent increased Fgf-23 mRNA. The significance of decreased 7B2\xe2\x80\xa2PC2 activity in XLH was confirmed by studies of hyp-mouse bone, which revealed significantly decreased Sgne1 (7B2) mRNA and 7B2 protein, and limited cleavage of proPC2 to active PC2. The expected downstream effects of these changes included decreased FGF-23 cleavage and increased FGF-23 synthesis, secondary to decreased BMP1-mediated degradation of DMP1. Subsequent Hexa-D-Arginine treatment of hyp-mice enhanced bone 7B2\xe2\x80\xa2PC2 activity, normalized FGF-23 degradation and production, and rescued the HYP phenotype. These data suggest that decreased PHEX-dependent 7B2\xe2\x80\xa2PC2 activity is central to the pathogenesis of XLH.'

aS"Image-based parcellation of the brain often leads to multiple disconnected anatomical structures, which pose significant challenges for analyses of morphological shapes. Existing shape models, such as the widely used spherical harmonic (SPHARM) representation, assume topological invariance, so are unable to simultaneously parameterize multiple disjoint structures. In such a situation, SPHARM has to be applied separately to each individual structure. We present a novel surface parameterization technique using 4D hyperspherical harmonics in representing multiple disjoint objects as a single analytic function, terming it HyperSPHARM. The underlying idea behind HyperSPHARM is to stereographically project an entire collection of disjoint 3D objects onto the 4D hypersphere and subsequently simultaneously parameterize them with the 4D hyperspherical harmonics. Hence, HyperSPHARM allows for a holistic treatment of multiple disjoint objects, unlike SPHARM. In an imaging dataset of healthy adult human brains, we apply HyperSPHARM to the hippocampi and amygdalae. The HyperSPHARM representations are employed as a data smoothing technique, while the HyperSPHARM coefficients are utilized in a support vector machine setting for object classification. HyperSPHARM yields nearly identical results as SPHARM, as will be shown in the paper. Its key advantage over SPHARM lies computationally; HyperSPHARM possess greater computational efficiency than SPHARM because it can parameterize multiple disjoint structures using much fewer basis functions and stereographic projection obviates SPHARM's burdensome surface flattening. In addition, HyperSPHARM can handle any type of topology, unlike SPHARM, whose analysis is confined to topologically invariant structures."

aS'Multi-parameter flow cytometry analysis of T regulatory (Treg) cells is a widely used approach in basic and translational research studies. This approach has been complicated by a lack of specific markers for Treg cells and lack of uniformity in the quantification of Treg cells. Given the central role of Treg cells in the inception and perpetuation of diverse immune responses as well as its target as a therapeutic, it is imperative to have established methodologies for Treg cell analysis that are robust and usable for studies with multiple subjects as well as multicenter studies. In this study, we describe an optimized multi-parameter flow cytometry protocol for the quantification of human Treg cells from freshly obtained and viably frozen samples and correlations with epigenetic Treg cell analysis (TSDR demethylation). We apply these two methodologies to characterize Treg cell differences between cord blood and adult peripheral blood. In summary, the optimized protocol appears to be robust for Treg cell quantification from freshly isolated or viably frozen cells and the multi-parameter flow cytometry findings are strongly positively correlated with TSDR demethylation thus providing several options for the characterization of Treg cell frequency and function in large translational or clinical studies.'

aS'Intimal hyperplasia is the cause of the recurrent occlusive vascular disease (restenosis). Drugs currently used to treat restenosis effectively inhibit smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation, but also inhibit the growth of the protective luminal endothelial cell (EC) lining, leading to thrombosis. To identify compounds that selectively inhibit SMC versus EC proliferation, we have developed a high-throughput screening (HTS) format using human cells and have employed this to screen a multiple compound collection (NIH Clinical Collection). We developed an automated, accurate proliferation assay in 96-well plates using human aortic SMCs and ECs. Using this HTS format we screened a 447-drug NIH Clinical Library. We identified 11 compounds that inhibited SMC proliferation greater than 50%, among which idarubicin exhibited a unique feature of preferentially inhibiting SMC versus EC proliferation. Concentration-response analysis revealed this differential effect most evident over an \xe2\x88\xbc10 nM-5 \xc2\xb5M window. In vivo testing of idarubicin in a rat carotid injury model at 14 days revealed an 80% reduction of intimal hyperplasia and a 45% increase of lumen size with no significant effect on re-endothelialization. Taken together, we have established a HTS assay of human vascular cell proliferation, and identified idarubicin as a selective inhibitor of SMC versus EC proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. Screening of larger and more diverse compound libraries may lead to the discovery of next-generation therapeutics that can inhibit intima hyperplasia without impairing re-endothelialization.'

aS"It is widely accepted that the convergence angle of a full veneer crown preparation should be as close to parallel as possible to attain adequate retention/resistance. The shape of the dog's canine tooth limits the veterinary dentists' ability to achieve the recommended convergence angle. However, the clinically achievable convergence angle of the canine tooth in dogs has not been evaluated. In addition, the convergence angle and other physical properties of a preparation, such as height and base diameter, have been shown to affect the retention/resistance of full veneer crowns, in vitro. This effect has not been evaluated clinically in the dog. Physical properties of 32 stone dies from full veneer crowns of canine teeth were studied to evaluate the clinically achievable convergence angle and the potential effect physical properties of the preparation had on the clinical outcome of the restoration. The clinically achievable convergence angle was much higher than the current recommendation. There was an association, albeit not statistically significant, between physical properties of a preparation (convergence angle, height, base diameter) and the clinical outcome of the restoration."

aS"Nicotine dependence is the leading cause of death in the United States. However, research on high rates of nicotine use in mental illness has primarily explained this co-morbidity as reflecting nicotine's therapeutic benefits, especially for cognitive symptoms, equating smoking with 'self-medication'. We used a leading neurodevelopmental model of mental illness in rats to prospectively test the alternative possibility that nicotine dependence pervades mental illness because nicotine is simply more addictive in mentally ill brains that involve developmental hippocampal dysfunction. Neonatal ventral hippocampal lesions (NVHL) have previously been demonstrated to produce post-adolescent-onset, pharmacological, neurobiological and cognitive-deficit features of schizophrenia. Here, we show that NVHLs increase adult nicotine self-administration, potentiating acquisition-intake, total nicotine consumed and drug seeking. Behavioral sensitization to nicotine in adolescence prior to self-administration is not accentuated by NVHLs in contrast to increased nicotine self-administration and behavioral sensitization documented in adult NVHL rats, suggesting periadolescent neurodevelopmental onset of nicotine addiction vulnerability in the NVHL model. Delivering a nicotine regimen approximating the exposure used in the sensitization and self-administration experiments (i.e. as a treatment) to adult rats did not specifically reverse NVHL-induced cortical-hippocampal-dependent cognitive deficits and actually worsened cognitive efficiency after nicotine treatment stopped, generating deficits that resemble those due to NVHLs. These findings represent the first prospective evidence demonstrating a causal link between disease processes in schizophrenia and nicotine addiction. Developmental cortical-temporal limbic dysfunction in mental illness may thus amplify nicotine's reinforcing effects and addiction risk and severity, even while producing cognitive deficits that are not specifically or substantially reversible with nicotine."

aS'Interpretation of clinical trials to alter the decline in \xce\xb2-cell function after diagnosis of type 1 diabetes depends on a robust understanding of the natural history of disease. Combining data from the Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet studies, we describe the natural history of \xce\xb2-cell function from shortly after diagnosis through 2 years post study randomization, assess the degree of variability between patients, and investigate factors that may be related to C-peptide preservation or loss. We found that 93% of individuals have detectable C-peptide 2 years from diagnosis. In 11% of subjects, there was no significant fall from baseline by 2 years. There was a biphasic decline in C-peptide; the C-peptide slope was -0.0245 pmol/mL/month (95% CI -0.0271 to -0.0215) through the first 12 months and -0.0079 (-0.0113 to -0.0050) from 12 to 24 months (P < 0.001). This pattern of fall in C-peptide over time has implications for understanding trial results in which effects of therapy are most pronounced early and raises the possibility that there are time-dependent differences in pathophysiology. The robust data on the C-peptide obtained under clinical trial conditions should be used in planning and interpretation of clinical trials.'

aS'Over the past two decades, structural biology has shown how T-cell receptors engage peptide/major histocompatibility complex (MHC) complexes and provided insight into the mechanisms underlying antigen specificity and cross-reactivity. Here we review and contextualize our contributions, which have emphasized the influence of structural changes and molecular flexibility. A repeated observation is the presence of conformational melding, in which the T-cell receptor (TCR), peptide, and in some cases, MHC protein cooperatively adjust in order for recognition to proceed. The structural changes reflect the intrinsic dynamics of the unligated proteins. Characterization of the dynamics of unligated TCR shows how binding loop motion can influence TCR cross-reactivity as well as specificity towards peptide and MHC. Examination of peptide dynamics indicates not only peptide-specific variation but also a peptide dependence to MHC flexibility. This latter point emphasizes that the TCR engages a composite peptide/MHC surface and that physically the receptor makes little distinction between the peptide and MHC. Much additional evidence for this can be found within the database of available structures, including our observations of a peptide dependence to the TCR binding mode and structural compensations for altered interatomic interactions, in which lost TCR-peptide interactions are replaced with TCR-MHC interactions. The lack of a hard-coded physical distinction between peptide and MHC has implications not only for specificity and cross-reactivity but also the mechanisms underlying MHC restriction as well as attempts to modulate and control TCR recognition.'

aS'The massive depletion of gastrointestinal-tract CD4 T cells is a hallmark of the acute phase of HIV infection. In contrast, the depletion of the lower-respiratory-tract mucosal CD4 T cells as measured in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid is more moderate and similar to the depletion of CD4 T cells observed in peripheral blood (PB). To understand better the dynamics of disease pathogenesis and the potential for the reconstitution of CD4 T cells in the lung and PB following the administration of effective antiretroviral therapy, we studied cell-associated viral loads, CD4 T-cell frequencies, and phenotypic and functional profiles of antigen-specific CD4 T cells from BAL fluid and blood before and after the initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The major findings to emerge were the following: (i) BAL CD4 T cells are not massively depleted or preferentially infected by HIV compared to levels for PB; (ii) BAL CD4 T cells reconstitute after the initiation of HAART, and their infection frequencies decrease; (iii) BAL CD4 T-cell reconstitution appears to occur via the local proliferation of resident BAL CD4 T cells rather than redistribution; and (iv) BAL CD4 T cells are more polyfunctional than CD4 T cells in blood, and their functional profile is relatively unchanged after the initiation of HAART. Taken together, these data suggest mechanisms for mucosal CD4 T-cell depletion and interventions that might aid in the reconstitution of mucosal CD4 T cells.'

aS'Sal-like protein 4 (SALL4) is a transcription factor that exists in two splice isoforms, SALL4a and SALL4b, and regulates transcription in embryonic stem cells, hematopoiesis, and acute myeloid leukemia. Constitutive overexpression of SALL4 in mice induces acute myeloid leukemia. Interestingly, a potential benefit of using SALL4 to facilitate ex vivo hematopoietic stem cell expansion has been proposed. However, distinct roles for how SALL4 contributes to normal versus malignant processes remain undefined. Here we show that SALL4b is the predominant isoform in murine hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors. Overexpression of either SALL4 isoform in hematopoietic stem cells or progenitors impairs hematopoietic colony formation and expansion in vitro. Lineage-negative bone marrow overexpressing SALL4b fails to engraft and reconstitute hematopoiesis when transplanted. We found that both SALL4a and SALL4b overexpression impair hematopoiesis, in part through dose-dependent repression of BMI1. Additionally, we have identified the following potential novel SALL4 target genes in hematopoiesis: ARID5B (SALL4a and SALL4b), EZH2, and KLF2 (SALL4a). Lastly, we found that SALL4 expression is variable in acute myeloid leukemia, ranging from no expression to levels comparable to embryonic stem cells. These results show that SALL4 isoforms contribute to only a subset of acute myeloid leukemia and that overexpression of SALL4 isoforms impairs hematopoiesis through repression of BMI1. Together these data demonstrate the sensitivity of hematopoiesis to appropriately balanced SALL4 expression, highlighting the importance of regulating this dynamic in potential therapeutic applications such as ex vivo stem cell expansion.'

aS'The tight skin mouse (Tsk(-/+)) is a model of scleroderma characterized by impaired vasoreactivity, increased oxidative stress, attenuated angiogenic response to VEGF and production of the angiogenesis inhibitor angiostatin. Low-level light therapy (LLLT) stimulates angiogenesis in myocardial infarction and chemotherapy-induced mucositis. We hypothesize that repetitive LLLT restores vessel growth in the ischemic hindlimb of Tsk(-/+) mice by attenuating angiostatin and enhancing angiomotin effects in vivo. C57Bl/6J and Tsk(-/+) mice underwent ligation of the femoral artery. Relative blood flow to the foot was measured using a laser Doppler imager. Tsk(-/+) mice received LLLT (670 nm, 50 mW cm(-2), 30 J cm(-2)) for 10 min per day for 14 days. Vascular density was determined using lycopersicom lectin staining. Immunofluorescent labeling, Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation were used to determine angiostatin and angiomotin expression. Recovery of blood flow to the ischemic limb was reduced in Tsk(-/+) compared with C57Bl/6 mice 2 weeks after surgery. LLLT treatment of Tsk(-/+) mice restored blood flow to levels observed in C57Bl/6 mice. Vascular density was decreased, angiostatin expression was enhanced and angiomotin depressed in the ischemic hindlimb of Tsk(-/+) mice. LLLT treatment reversed these abnormalities. LLLT stimulates angiogenesis by increasing angiomotin and decreasing angiostatin expression in the ischemic hindlimb of Tsk(-/+) mice.'

aS'We studied the change in the first-phase insulin response (FPIR) during the progression to type 1 diabetes (T1D). Seventy-four oral insulin trial progressors to T1D from the Diabetes Prevention Trial-Type 1 with at least one FPIR measurement after baseline and before diagnosis were studied. The FPIR was examined longitudinally in 26 progressors who had FPIR measurements during each of the 3 years before diagnosis. The association between the change from the baseline FPIR to the last FPIR and time to diagnosis was studied in the remainder (n = 48). The 74 progressors had lower baseline FPIR values than nonprogressors (n = 270), with adjustments made for age and BMI. In the longitudinal analysis of the 26 progressors, there was a greater decline in the FPIR from 1.5 to 0.5 years before diagnosis than from 2.5 to 1.5 years before diagnosis. This accelerated decline was also evident in a regression analysis of the 48 remaining progressors in whom the rate of decline became more marked with the approaching diagnosis. The patterns of decline were similar between the longitudinal and regression analyses. There is an acceleration of decline in the FPIR during the progression to T1D, which becomes especially marked between 1.5 and 0.5 years before diagnosis.'

aS'Chronic neuropathic pain management is a worldwide concern. Pharmaceutical companies globally have historically targeted ion channels as the therapeutic catechism with many blockbuster successes. Remarkably, no new pain therapeutic has been approved by European or American regulatory agencies over the last decade. This article will provide an overview of an alternative approach to ion channel drug discovery: targeting regulators of ion channels, specifically focusing on voltage-gated calcium channels. We will highlight the discovery of an anti-nociceptive peptide derived from a novel calcium channel interacting partner - the collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2). In vivo administration of this peptide reduces pain behavior in a number of models of neuropathic pain without affecting sympathetic-associated cardiovascular activity, memory retrieval, sensorimotor function, or depression. A CRMP2-derived peptide analgesic, with restricted access to the CNS, represents a completely novel approach to the treatment of severe pain with an improved safety profile. As peptides now represent one of the fastest growing classes of new drugs, it is expected that peptide targeting of protein interactions within the calcium channel complex may be a paradigm shift in ion channel drug discovery.'

aS'Cerebral structural and functional alterations have been reported after chemotherapy for non-CNS cancers, yet the causative mechanism behind these changes remains unclear. This study employed a novel, non-invasive, MRI-based neuroimaging measure to provide the first direct longitudinal measurement of resting cerebral perfusion in breast cancer patients, which was tested for association with changes in cognitive function and gray matter density. Perfusion was measured using pulsed arterial spin labeling MRI in women with breast cancer treated with (N\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a27) or without (N\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a26) chemotherapy and matched healthy controls (N\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a26) after surgery before other treatments (baseline), and one month after chemotherapy completion or yoked intervals. Voxel-based analysis was employed to assess perfusion in gray matter; changes were examined in relation to overall neuropsychological test performance and frontal gray matter density changes measured by structural MRI. Baseline perfusion was not significantly different across groups. Unlike control groups, chemotherapy-treated patients demonstrated significantly increased perfusion post-treatment relative to baseline, which was statistically significant relative to controls in the right precentral gyrus. This perfusion increase was negatively correlated with baseline overall neuropsychological performance, but was not associated with frontal gray matter density reduction. However, decreased frontal gray matter density was associated with decreased perfusion in bilateral frontal and parietal lobes in the chemotherapy-treated group. These findings indicate that chemotherapy is associated with alterations in cerebral perfusion which are both related to and independent of gray matter changes. This pattern of results suggests the involvement of multiple mechanisms of chemotherapy-induced cognitive dysfunction. Additionally, lower baseline cognitive function may be a risk factor for treatment-associated perfusion dysregulation. Future research is needed to clarify these mechanisms, identify individual differences in susceptibility to treatment-associated changes, and further examine perfusion change over time in survivors.'

aS'Receptor internalization increases the flexibility and scope of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. CB(1) and CB(2) cannabinoid receptors undergo internalization after sustained exposure to agonists. However, it is not known whether different agonists internalize CB(2) to different extents. Because CB(2) is a promising therapeutic target, understanding its trafficking in response to different agonists is necessary for a complete understanding of its biology. Here we profile a number of cannabinoid receptor ligands and provide evidence for marked functional selectivity of cannabinoid receptor internalization. Classic, aminoalkylindole, bicyclic, cannabilactone, iminothiazole cannabinoid, and endocannabinoid ligands varied greatly in their effects on CB(1) and CB(2) trafficking. Our most striking finding was that (R)-(+)-[2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-(4-morpholinylmethyl) pyrrolo-[1,2,3-d,e]-1,4-benzoxazin-6-yl]-1-naphthalenyl-methanone (WIN55,212-2) (and other aminoalkylindoles) failed to promote CB(2) receptor internalization, whereas 5-(1,1-dimethylheptyl)-2-(5-hydroxy-2-(3-hydroxypropyl)cyclohexyl)phenol (CP55,940) robustly internalized CB(2) receptors. Furthermore, WIN55,212-2 competitively antagonized CP55,940-induced CB(2) internalization. Despite these differences in internalization, both compounds activated CB(2) receptors as measured by extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 phosphorylation and recruitment of \xce\xb2-arrestin(2) to the membrane. In contrast, whereas CP55,940 inhibited voltage-gated calcium channels via CB(2) receptor activation, WIN55,212-2 was ineffective on its own and antagonized the effects of CP55,940. On the basis of the differences we found between these two ligands, we also tested the effects of other cannabinoids on these signaling pathways and found additional evidence for functional selectivity of CB(2) ligands. These novel data highlight that WIN55,212-2 and other cannabinoids show strong functional selectivity at CB(2) receptors and suggest that different classes of CB(2) ligands may produce diverse physiological effects, emphasizing that each class needs to be separately evaluated for therapeutic efficacy.'

aS"The instantaneous rate of change of alcohol exposure (slope) may contribute to changes in measures of brain function following administration of alcohol that are usually attributed to breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) acting alone. To test this proposition, a 2-session experiment was designed in which carefully prescribed, constant-slope trajectories of BrAC intersected at the same exposure level and time since the exposure began. This paper presents the methods and limitations of the experimental design.Individualized intravenous infusion rate profiles of 6% ethanol (EtOH) that achieved the constant-slope trajectories for an individual were precomputed using a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model. Adjusting the parameters of the model allowed each infusion profile to account for the subject's EtOH distribution and elimination kinetics. Sessions were conducted in randomized order and made no use of feedback of BrAC measurements obtained during the session to modify the precalculated infusion profiles. In one session, an individual's time course of exposure, BrAC(t), was prescribed to rise at a constant rate of 6.0 mg% per minute until it reached 68 mg% and then descend at -1.0 mg% per minute; in the other, to rise at a rate of 3.0 mg% per minute. The 2 exposure trajectories were designed to intersect at a BrAC (t = 20 minutes) = 60 mg% at an experimental time of 20 minutes.Intersection points for 54 of 61 subjects were within prescribed deviations (range of \xc2\xb1 3 mg% and \xc2\xb1 4 minutes from the nominal intersection point).Results confirmed the feasibility of applying the novel methods for achieving the intended time courses of the BrAC, with technical problems limiting success to 90% of the individuals tested."

aS'The objective of this study was to investigate whether cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2 ), an important isoform of PLA2 that mediates the release of arachidonic acid, plays a role in the pathogenesis of spinal cord injury (SCI).A combination of molecular, histological, immunohistochemical, and behavioral assessments were used to test whether blocking cPLA2 activation pharmacologically or genetically reduced cell death, protected spinal cord tissue, and improved behavioral recovery after a contusive SCI performed at the 10th thoracic level in adult mice.SCI significantly increased cPLA2 expression and activation. Activated cPLA2 was localized mainly in neurons and oligodendrocytes. Notably, the SCI-induced cPLA2 activation was mediated by the extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathway. In vitro, activation of cPLA2 by ceramide-1-phosphate or A23187 induced spinal neuronal death, which was substantially reversed by arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone, a cPLA2 inhibitor. Remarkably, blocking cPLA2 pharmacologically at 30 minutes postinjury or genetically deleting cPLA2 in mice ameliorated motor deficits, and reduced cell loss and tissue damage after SCI.cPLA2 may play a key role in the pathogenesis of SCI, at least in the C57BL/6 mouse, and as such could be an attractive therapeutic target for ameliorating secondary tissue damage and promoting recovery of function after SCI.'

aS'In autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets (ADHR), fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) resists cleavage, causing increased plasma FGF23 levels. The clinical phenotype includes variable onset during childhood or adulthood and waxing/waning of hypophosphatemia. Delayed onset after puberty in females suggests iron status may be important.Studies were performed to test the hypothesis that plasma C-terminal and intact FGF23 concentrations are related to serum iron concentrations in ADHR.Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of ADHR and a cross-sectional study in healthy subjects were conducted at an academic medical center.Participants included 37 subjects with ADHR mutations from four kindreds and 158 healthy adult controls.The relationships of serum iron concentrations with plasma C-terminal and intact FGF23 concentrations were evaluated.Serum phosphate and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D correlated negatively with C-terminal FGF23 and intact FGF23 in ADHR but not in controls. Serum iron was negatively correlated to both C-terminal FGF23 (r = -0.386; P < 0.05) and intact FGF23 (r = -0.602; P < 0.0001) in ADHR. However, control subjects also demonstrated a negative relationship of serum iron with C-terminal FGF23 (r = -0.276; P < 0.001) but no relationship with intact FGF23. Longitudinally in ADHR subjects, C-terminal FGF23 and intact FGF23 concentrations changed negatively with iron concentrations (P < 0.001 and P = 0.055, respectively), serum phosphate changed negatively with C-terminal FGF23 and intact FGF23 (P < 0.001), and there was a positive relationship between serum iron and phosphate (P < 0.001).Low serum iron is associated with elevated FGF23 in ADHR. However, in controls, low serum iron was also associated with elevated C-terminal FGF23, but not intact FGF23, suggesting cleavage maintains homeostasis despite increased FGF23 expression.'

aS'The ubiquity of protein-protein interactions in biological signaling offers ample opportunities for therapeutic intervention. We previously identified a peptide, designated CBD3, that suppressed inflammatory and neuropathic behavioral hypersensitivity in rodents by inhibiting the ability of collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP-2) to bind to N-type voltage-activated calcium channels (CaV2.2) [Brittain et al. Nature Medicine 17:822-829 (2011)].Here, we utilized SPOTScan analysis to identify an optimized variation of the CBD3 peptide (CBD3A6K) that bound with greater affinity to Ca\xc2\xb2\xe2\x81\xba channels. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that the CBD3A6K peptide was more stable and less prone to the unfolding observed with the parent CBD3 peptide. This mutant peptide, conjugated to the cell penetrating motif of the HIV transduction domain protein TAT, exhibited greater anti-nociception in a rodent model of AIDS therapy-induced peripheral neuropathy when compared to the parent TAT-CBD3 peptide. Remarkably, intraperitoneal administration of TAT-CBD3A6K produced none of the minor side effects (i.e. tail kinking, body contortion) observed with the parent peptide. Interestingly, excitability of dissociated small diameter sensory neurons isolated from rats was also reduced by TAT-CBD3A6K peptide suggesting that suppression of excitability may be due to inhibition of T- and R-type Ca\xc2\xb2\xe2\x81\xba channels. TAT-CBD3A6K had no effect on depolarization-evoked calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) release compared to vehicle control.Collectively, these results establish TAT-CBD3A6K as a peptide therapeutic with greater efficacy in an AIDS therapy-induced model of peripheral neuropathy than its parent peptide, TAT-CBD3. Structural modifications of the CBD3 scaffold peptide may result in peptides with selectivity against a particular subset of voltage-gated calcium channels resulting in a multipharmacology of action on the target.'

aS"Aberrant expression of SOX4 in endometrial cancer has been identified and partially was contributed to hypermethylation of miR-129-2. Other miRNAs are suspected to influence SOX 4 as well. The current study seeks to identify other hypermethylated miRNAs that regulate SOX4 in endometrial carcinomas.Methylation levels of miRNA promoter regions were measured by combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA) and pyrosequencing assays. Gene expression was determined by RT-qPCR. Methylation level of a miRNA locus was corrected with clinicopathologic factors for 252 gynecological specimens.In silico analysis identified 13 miRNA loci bound on the 3'-UTR of SOX4. Using COBRA assays, increased methylation of miR-203, miR-219-2, miR-596, and miR-618 was detected in endometrial cancer cells relative to those seen in a normal cell line and in normal endometrium. Transfection of a miR-203 mimic decreased SOX4 gene expression. Hypermethylation of miR-203 was detected in 52% of type I endometrioid endometrial carcinomas (n=131) but was not seen in any of 10 uninvolved normal endometria (P<0.001). Methylation status of miR-203 was significantly associated with microsatellite instability and MLH1 methylation in endometrial tumors (P<0.001). Furthermore, hypermethylation of miR-203 was found in endometrioid and clear endometrial subtype tumors, but not in cervical squamous cell and ovarian carcinomas.Hypermethylation of miR-203 is a frequent event in endometrial carcinomas and is strongly associated with microsatellite instability and MLH1 methylation status. Thus, miR-203 methylation level might represent a marker for patients with endometrioid and clear endometrial sub-cancers."

aS'Preeclampsia affects 3-8% of pregnancies and is a major cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. This complex disorder is characterized by alterations in the immune and vascular systems and involves multiple organs. There is strong evidence for a genetic contribution to preeclampsia. Two different single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 2 (ERAP2) gene were recently reported to be associated with increased risk for preeclampsia in two different populations. ERAP2 is expressed in placental tissue and it is involved in immune responses, inflammation, and blood pressure regulation; making it is an attractive preeclampsia candidate gene. Furthermore, ERAP2 expression is altered in first trimester placentas of women destined to develop preeclampsia.A case-control design was used to test for associations between two SNPs in ERAP2, rs2549782 and rs17408150, and preeclampsia status in 1103 Chilean maternal-fetal dyads and 1637 unpaired African American samples (836 maternal, 837 fetal).We found that the fetal minor allele (G) of rs2549782 was associated with an increased risk for preeclampsia in the African American population (P = 0.009), but not in the Chilean population. We found no association between rs17408150 and risk for preeclampsia in the Chilean population. Association between rs17408150 and risk for preeclampsia was not tested in the African American population due to the absence of the minor allele in this population.We report an association between fetal ERAP2 and preeclampsia in an African American population. In conjunction with previous studies, which have found maternal associations with this gene in an Australian/New Zealand population and a Norwegian population, ERAP2 has now been associated with preeclampsia in three populations. This provides strong evidence that ERAP2 plays a role in the development of preeclampsia.'

aS'Minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) detection is difficult because of the unavailability of short screening tools. Therefore, MHE patients can remain undiagnosed and untreated. The aim of this study was to use a Stroop smartphone application (app) (EncephalApp_Stroop) to screen for MHE. The app and standard psychometric tests (SPTs; 2 of 4 abnormal is MHE, gold standard), psychometric hepatic encephalopathy score (PHES), and inhibitory control tests (ICTs) were administered to patients with cirrhosis (with or without previous overt hepatic encephalopathy; OHE) and age-matched controls from two centers; a subset underwent retesting. A separate validation cohort was also recruited. Stroop has an "off" state with neutral stimuli and an "on" state with incongruent stimuli. Outcomes included time to complete five correct runs as well as number of trials needed in on (Ontime) and off (Offtime) states. Stroop results were compared between controls and patients with cirrhosis with or without OHE and those with or without MHE (using SPTs, ICTs, and PHES). Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to diagnose MHE in patients with cirrhosis with or without previous OHE. One hundred and twenty-five patients with cirrhosis (43 previous OHE) and 134 controls were included in the original cohort. App times were correlated with Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (Offtime: r = 0.57; Ontime: r = 0.61; P < 0.0001) and were worst in previous OHE patients, compared to the rest and controls. Stroop performance was also significantly impaired in those with MHE, compared to those without MHE, according to SPTs, ICTs, and PHES (all P < 0.0001). A cutoff of >274.9 seconds (Ontime plus Offtime) had an area under the curve of 0.89 in all patients and 0.84 in patients without previous OHE for MHE diagnosis using SPT as the gold standard. The validation cohort showed 78% sensitivity and 90% specificity with the >274.9-seconds Ontime plus Offtime cutoff. App result patterns were similar between the centers. Test-retest reliability in controls and those without previous OHE was good; a learning effect on Ontime in patients with cirrhosis without previous OHE was noted.The Stroop smartphone app is a short, valid, and reliable tool for screening of MHE.'

aS'von Willebrand factor (VWF) plays a key role in coagulation by tethering platelets to injured subendothelium through binding sites for collagen and platelet GPIb. Collagen binding assays (VWF:CB), however, are not part of the routine work-up for von Willebrand disease (VWD).This study presents data on collagen binding for healthy controls and VWD subjects to compare three different collagens.VWF antigen (VWF:Ag), VWF ristocetin cofactor activity and VWF:CB with types I, III and VI collagen were examined for samples obtained from the Zimmerman Program.Mean VWF:CB in healthy controls was similar and highly correlated for types I, III and VI collagen. The mean VWF:CB/VWF:Ag ratios for types I, III and VI collagen were 1.31, 1.19 and 1.21, respectively. In type 1 VWD subjects, VWF:CB was similar to VWF:Ag with mean VWF:CB/VWF:Ag ratios for types I, III and VI collagen of 1.32, 1.08 and 1.1, respectively. For type 2A and 2B subjects, VWF:CB was uniformly low, with mean ratios of 0.62 and 0.7 for type I collagen, 0.38 and 0.4 for type III collagen, and 0.5 and 0.47 for type VI collagen.Normal ranges for type I, III and VI collagen are correlated, but higher values were obtained with type I collagen as compared with types III and VI. The low VWF:CB in type 2A and 2B subjects suggests that VWF:CB may also supplement analysis of multimer distribution. However, these results reflect only one set of assay conditions per collagen type and therefore may not be generalizable to all collagen assays.'

aS'Diagnosis and classification of VWD is aided by molecular analysis of the VWF gene. Because VWF polymorphisms have not been fully characterized, we performed VWF laboratory testing and gene sequencing of 184 healthy controls with a negative bleeding history. The controls included 66 (35.9%) African Americans (AAs). We identified 21 new sequence variations, 13 (62%) of which occurred exclusively in AAs and 2 (G967D, T2666M) that were found in 10%-15% of the AA samples, suggesting they are polymorphisms. We identified 14 sequence variations reported previously as VWF mutations, the majority of which were type 1 mutations. These controls had VWF Ag levels within the normal range, suggesting that these sequence variations might not always reduce plasma VWF levels. Eleven mutations were found in AAs, and the frequency of M740I, H817Q, and R2185Q was 15%-18%. Ten AA controls had the 2N mutation H817Q; 1 was homozygous. The average factor VIII level in this group was 99 IU/dL, suggesting that this variation may confer little or no clinical symptoms. This study emphasizes the importance of sequencing healthy controls to understand ethnic-specific sequence variations so that asymptomatic sequence variations are not misidentified as mutations in other ethnic or racial groups.'

aS'Little is known about the effects of different quantities of whey protein on exercise training-induced changes in body composition and indices of metabolic syndrome in middle-aged overweight and obese adults. Therefore, we examined the effects of consuming 0.8-MJ supplements with 0 (n = 126), 10 (n = 112), 20 (n = 44), or 30 (n = 45) g whey protein twice daily in conjunction with resistance (2 d/wk) and aerobic (1 d/wk) exercise training in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, community-based 9-mo study in men (n = 117) and women (n = 210); (age: 48 \xc2\xb1 7.9 y; BMI: 30.0 \xc2\xb1 2.8 kg/m(2)). Whey protein supplementation did not influence any of the following outcomes, some of which were affected by training. Among all participants, strength increased by 15 \xc2\xb1 12% (P < 0.001) and maximal oxygen uptake capacity (VO(2)max) increased by 9 \xc2\xb1 15% (P < 0.001). Body weight was unchanged (0.1 \xc2\xb1 3.7 kg, P = 0.80), lean body mass increased by 1.9 \xc2\xb1 2.8% (0.95 \xc2\xb1 1.3 kg, P < 0.001), and fat mass decreased by 2.6 \xc2\xb1 9.4% (-0.86 \xc2\xb1 3.1 kg, P = 0.001).

Plasma concentrations of TG; total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol; C-reactive protein; plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; blood pressure; and waist circumference were unchanged. Whey protein supplementation did not affect exercise training-induced responses in body composition and indices of metabolic syndrome in middle-aged overweight and obese adults who maintained body weight.'

aS"The immunopathogenesis of type 1 diabetes mellitus is associated with T-cell autoimmunity. To be fully active, immune T cells need a co-stimulatory signal in addition to the main antigen-driven signal. Abatacept modulates co-stimulation and prevents full T-cell activation. We evaluated the effect of abatacept in recent-onset type 1 diabetes.In this multicentre, double-blind, randomised controlled trial, patients aged 6-45 years recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive abatacept (10 mg/kg, maximum 1000 mg per dose) or placebo infusions intravenously on days 1, 14, 28, and monthly for a total of 27 infusions over 2 years. Computer-generated permuted block randomisation was used, with a block size of 3 and stratified by participating site. Neither patients nor research personnel were aware of treatment assignments. The primary outcome was baseline-adjusted geometric mean 2-h area-under-the-curve (AUC) serum C-peptide concentration after a mixed-meal tolerance test at 2 years' follow-up. Analysis was by intention to treat for all patients for whom data were available. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00505375.112 patients were assigned to treatment groups (77 abatacept, 35 placebo). Adjusted C-peptide AUC was 59% (95% CI 6\xc2\xb71-112) higher at 2 years with abatacept (n=73, 0\xc2\xb7378 nmol/L) than with placebo (n=30, 0\xc2\xb7238 nmol/L; p=0\xc2\xb70029). The difference between groups was present throughout the trial, with an estimated 9\xc2\xb76 months' delay (95% CI 3\xc2\xb747-15\xc2\xb76) in C-peptide reduction with abatacept. There were few infusion-related adverse events (36 reactions occurred in 17 [22%] patients on abatacept and 11 reactions in six [17%] on placebo). There was no increase in infections (32 [42%] patients on abatacept vs 15 [43%] on placebo) or neutropenia (seven [9%] vs five [14%]).Co-stimulation modulation with abatacept slowed reduction in \xce\xb2-cell function over 2 years. The beneficial effect suggests that T-cell activation still occurs around the time of clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. Yet, despite continued administration of abatacept over 24 months, the decrease in \xce\xb2-cell function with abatacept was parallel to that with placebo after 6 months of treatment, causing us to speculate that T-cell activation lessens with time. Further observation will establish whether the beneficial effect continues after cessation of abatacept infusions.US National Institutes of Health."

At week 4, those not achieving 50% fewer hot flashes were increased to two pills daily (20 mg/d or 2 placebo pills).The Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale; correlates were variables from hot flash diaries; predictors were baseline demographics, clinical variables, depression, anxiety, sleep quality, and hot flashes.Compared to placebo, escitalopram significantly reduced hot flash interference by 6.0 points at week 4 and 3.4 points at week 8 more than placebo. Reductions in hot flash interference correlated with changes in hot flash diary variables. However, baseline variables did not significantly predict reductions in hot flash interference.Escitalopram (10-20 mg/d) for 8 weeks improves women's quality of life and this benefit did not vary by demographic, clinical, mood, sleep, or hot flash variables.NCT00894543."

aS"Three small trials suggest that intravenous immunoglobulin can affect biomarkers and symptoms of mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. We tested the safety, effective dose, and infusion interval of intravenous immunoglobulin in such patients.We did a multicentre, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial at seven sites in the USA and five in Germany. Participants with probable Alzheimer's disease aged 50-85 years were randomly assigned (by a computer-generated randomisation sequence, with block sizes of eight) to infusions every 4 weeks (0\xc2\xb72, 0\xc2\xb75, or 0\xc2\xb78 g intravenous immunoglobulin per kg bodyweight, or placebo) or infusions every 2 weeks (0\xc2\xb71, 0\xc2\xb725, or 0\xc2\xb74 g/kg, or placebo). Patients, caregivers, investigators assessing outcomes, and staff at imaging facilities and the clinical research organisation were masked to treatment allocation, but dispensing pharmacists, the statistician, and the person responsible for final PET analyses were not. Treatment was masked with opaque pouches and infusion lines. The primary endpoint was median area under the curve (AUC) of plasma amyloid \xce\xb2 (A\xce\xb2)(1-40) between the last infusion and the final visit (2 weeks or 4 weeks depending on infusion interval) in the intention-to-treat population. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00812565) and controlled-trials.com (ISRCTN64846759).89 patients were assessed for eligibility, of whom 58 were enrolled and 55 included in the primary analysis. Median AUC of plasma A\xce\xb2(1-40) was not significantly different for intravenous immunoglobulin compared with placebo for five of the six intervention groups (-18\xc2\xb70 [range -1347\xc2\xb70 to 1068\xc2\xb75] for 0\xc2\xb72 g/kg, -364\xc2\xb73 [-5834\xc2\xb75 to 1953\xc2\xb75] for 0\xc2\xb75 g/kg, and -351\xc2\xb78 [-1084\xc2\xb70 to 936\xc2\xb75] for 0\xc2\xb78 g/kg every 4 weeks vs -116\xc2\xb73 [-1379\xc2\xb70 to 5266\xc2\xb70] for placebo; and -13\xc2\xb78 [-1729\xc2\xb70 to 307\xc2\xb70] for 0\xc2\xb71 g/kg, and -32\xc2\xb75 [-1102\xc2\xb75 to 451\xc2\xb75] for 0\xc2\xb725 g/kg every 2 weeks vs 159\xc2\xb75 [51\xc2\xb75 to 303\xc2\xb70] for placebo; p>0\xc2\xb705 for all). The difference in median AUC of plasma A\xce\xb2(1-40) between the 0\xc2\xb74 g/kg every 2 weeks group (47\xc2\xb70 [range -341\xc2\xb70 to 72\xc2\xb75]) and the placebo group was significant (p=0\xc2\xb70216). 25 of 42 (60%) patients in the intervention group versus nine of 14 (64%) receiving placebo had an adverse event. Four of 42 (10%) patients in the intravenous immunoglobulin group versus four of 14 (29%) receiving placebo had a serious adverse event, including one stroke in the intervention group.Intravenous immunoglobulin may have an acceptable safety profile. Our results did not accord with those from previous studies. Longer trials with greater power are needed to assess the cognitive and functional effects of intravenous immunoglobulin in patients with Alzheimer's disease."

aS'we performed the first test in humans of whether aspirin at clinically relevant doses increases nitric oxide (NO) formation.seventy primary prevention patients with metabolic syndrome were randomly assigned to 81 mg, 162.5 mg, 325 mg, 650 mg, or 1300 mg aspirin daily for 12 weeks to test changes in heme oxygenase (HO-1), a downstream target of NO formation and asymmetrical dimethylarginine (ADMA), a competitive inhibitor of NO synthase.for HO-1, the mean was 29.37 nanograms per milliliter at baseline and 57.45 at 12 weeks giving a mean ratio (MR) of 1.96 (P < .001) and 95% confidence interval (CI) from 1.91 to 2.00. There was no effect modification by dose or gender (P = .341). For ADMA, the mean was 1.70 micromoles per liter at baseline and 0.81 at 12 weeks, giving an MR of 0.48 (P < .001) and CI from 0.46 to 0.49. There was no effect modification by dose but a possible difference by gender (P = .055).in high-risk primary prevention patients, aspirin significantly increases markers of NO formation. All doses produce similar increases in HO-1 and decreases in ADMA. The antiplatelet properties of aspirin to irreversibly inhibit platelet dependent cyclooxygenase are sufficient to explain benefits in patients with occlusive vascular diseases. Nonetheless, these data contribute to the formulation of the hypothesis that aspirin has additional beneficial effects mediated through NO formation. Further research, including direct randomized comparisons on atherosclerosis using noninvasive techniques as well as on occlusive vascular disease events, is necessary to test whether this hypothesis has clinical or public health relevance.'

aS'Recurrent aortic arch obstruction after the Norwood procedure continues to be a source of morbidity. We sought to determine if a modified interdigitating technique for aortic arch reconstruction during the Norwood procedure decreased recurrent arch obstruction.A total of 142 consecutive infants undergoing the Norwood procedure were divided into groups according to surgical technique: Group 1 (n = 79, January 1999 to May 2003) underwent arch reconstruction with complete coarctectomy followed by anastomosis of the descending aorta to the transverse arch. Group 2 (n = 63, June 2003 to September 2006) underwent complete coarctectomy plus a modified interdigitating technique. Catheterization before stage 2 palliation was reviewed for hemodynamics and angiographic arch dimensions, and a coarctation index was calculated.Reintervention for recurrent coarctation occurred in 28% (22/79) of group 1 patients compared with 2% (1/63) of group 2 patients (P = .001). Aortic pressures, gradients, dimensions, and coarctation index were consistently more favorable for group 2.Coarctectomy plus an interdigitating arch anastomosis was superior to coarctectomy alone and resulted in a dramatically decreased incidence of recurrent arch obstruction.'

aS"Risperidone has been used to treat behavioral symptoms, such as delusions and agitation, in people with Alzheimer's disease. The relationship between magnitude and variability of risperidone and 9-hydroxy risperidone exposure and the relationship with time to discontinuation of the medication were explored. Sixty-five subjects from the Clinical Antipsychotic Trial of Intervention Effectiveness-Alzheimer's Disease Trial that received risperidone were included in this study. Eighteen subjects completed the study without switching medication (completers on risperidone), whereas 47 discontinued the medication. Those who discontinued were divided into 2 groups according to responsiveness to therapy. Using Cox proportional survival regression analysis, we estimated time to discontinuation and factors associated with treatment discontinuation including age, dose, body mass index, neuropsychiatric inventory baseline score, and average exposure (area under the curve [AUC]) to risperidone and 9-hydroxy risperidone. Twenty-four and 17 subjects discontinued therapy because of inadequate therapeutic effect and side effects, respectively (6 subjects were excluded because of missing information about reason for switching or discontinuation). Discontinuation hazards for those with a higher than median AUC of the metabolite were 2.54 (P = 0.029; inadequate and side effect group combined) and 3.48 (P = 0.025; inadequate effect group) times that of those in the lower than median AUC group. None of the other covariates contributed significantly to the switching hazard. Risperidone metabolite, 9-hydroxy risperidone concentrations, correlated with the risk of switching or discontinuing the medication, suggesting that 9-hydroxy risperidone contributes to adverse events and intolerability in dementia patients."

aS'Neuromuscular blockade may improve outcomes in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. In post-cardiac arrest patients receiving therapeutic hypothermia, neuromuscular blockade is often used to prevent shivering. Our objective was to determine whether neuromuscular blockade is associated with improved outcomes after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.A post hoc analysis of a prospective observational study of comatose adult (>18 years) out-of-hospital cardiac arrest at 4 tertiary cardiac arrest centers. The primary exposure of interest was neuromuscular blockade for 24h following return of spontaneous circulation and primary outcomes were in-hospital survival and functional status at hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes were evolution of oxygenation (PaO2:FiO2), and change in lactate. We tested the primary outcomes of in-hospital survival and neurologically intact survival with multivariable logistic regression. Secondary outcomes were tested with multivariable linear mixed-models.A total of 111 patients were analyzed. In patients with 24h of sustained neuromuscular blockade, the crude survival rate was 14/18 (78%) compared to 38/93 (41%) in patients without sustained neuromuscular blockade (p=0.004). After multivariable adjustment, neuromuscular blockade was associated with survival (adjusted OR: 7.23, 95% CI: 1.56-33.38). There was a trend toward improved functional outcome with neuromuscular blockade (50% versus 28%; p=0.07). Sustained neuromuscular blockade was associated with improved lactate clearance (adjusted p=0.01).We found that early neuromuscular blockade for a 24-h period is associated with an increased probability of survival. Secondarily, we found that early, sustained neuromuscular blockade is associated with improved lactate clearance.'

aS'To examine the clinical effects of equivalent doses of single-blind (SB; patient-blind) lisdexamfetamine (LDX) and mixed amphetamine salts-immediate release (MAS-IR) on adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in a placebo (PBO)-controlled, crossover design.Twenty-four subjects were treated sequentially in a fixed order with (1) SB PBO (matching LDX) for 1 week, (2) SB LDX (up to 70 mg/day) for 5 weeks, (3) SB PBO washout for 3 weeks, and (4) open-label treatment MAS-IR (tid up to 45 mg/day) for 5 weeks. Clinical effects on ADHD and executive function were assessed weekly throughout the trial with the ADHD Rating Scale with adult prompts, the Clinical Global Impression Severity Scale (CGI-S), and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF).Lisdexamfetamine and MAS-IR were generally well tolerated. Significant and equal reductions on ADHD clinician ratings were seen. Significantly greater reductions in CGI-S and selected BRIEF subsets were observed in LDX over MAS-IR treatment. However, in general, baseline scores for MAS-IR treatment did not fully return to the LDX baseline. Adherence in this structured and monitored clinical trial was good for once daily LDX and 3 times a day MAS-IR.In this crossover study, both LDX and MAS-IR had significant effects on ADHD clinician ratings and measures of executive function (with response rates of about 80%); patients in this monitored clinical trial were adherent with once daily LDX and 3 times a day MAS-IR, which may not be the case in real-world clinical practice. The findings of some superiority of LDX over MAS-IR on the CGI-S and BRIEF ratings may be influenced by the variability in the baselines used, but nevertheless should be further investigated in larger scale, parallel-design clinical trials.'

aS"The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness and tolerability of aripiprazole for irritability in pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) and Asperger's disorder.This is a 14-week, prospective, open-label investigation of aripiprazole in 25 children and adolescents diagnosed with PDD-NOS or Asperger's disorder. Primary outcome measures included the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) scale and the Irritability subscale of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC-I).Twenty-five subjects, ages 5-17 years (mean 8.6 years) received a mean final aripiprazole dosage of 7.8 mg/day (range 2.5-15 mg/day). Full-scale intelligence quotient (IQ) scores ranged from 48 to 122 (mean 84). Twenty-two (88%) of 25 subjects were responders in regard to interfering symptoms of irritability, including aggression, self-injury, and tantrums, with a final CGI-I of 1 or 2 (very much or much improved) and a 25% or greater improvement on the ABC-I. The final mean CGI-I was 1.6 (p <or= 0.0001). ABC-I scores ranged from 18 to 43 (mean 29) at baseline, whereas scores at week 14 ranged from 0 to 27 (mean 8.1) (p <or= 0.001). Aripiprazole was well tolerated. Mild extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) were reported in 9 subjects. Age- and sex-normed body mass index (BMI) increased from a mean value of 20.3 at baseline to 21.1 at end point (p <or= 0.04). Prolactin significantly decreased from a mean value of 9.3 at baseline to 2.9 at end point (p <or= 0.0001). No subject exited the study due to a drug-related adverse event.These preliminary data suggest that aripiprazole may be effective and well tolerated for severe irritability in pediatric patients with PDD-NOS or Asperger's disorder. Larger-scale placebo-controlled studies are needed to elucidate the efficacy and tolerability of aripiprazole in this understudied population."

aS'The aim of this study was to determine the effect of escitalopram on insomnia symptoms and subjective sleep quality in healthy perimenopausal and postmenopausal women with hot flashes.A randomized, blinded, multicenter, placebo-controlled parallel-group 8-week trial with 205 women (95 African American, 102 white, 8 other) was conducted between July 2009 and June 2010. The participants received escitalopram (10-20 mg/d) or placebo. Insomnia symptoms (Insomnia Severity Index [ISI]) and subjective sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI]) at weeks 4 and 8 were the prespecified secondary outcomes. A total of 199 women (97%) provided ISI data, and 194 (95%) women provided PSQI data at follow-up.At baseline, mean hot flash frequency was 9.78 per day (SD, 5.60), mean ISI was 11.4 (SD, 6.3), and mean PSQI was 8.0 (SD, 3.7). Treatment with escitalopram reduced ISI at week 8 (mean difference, -2.00; 95% CI, -3.43 to -0.57; P < 0.001 overall treatment effect), with mean differences of -4.73 (95% CI, -5.72 to -3.75) in the escitalopram group and -2.73 (95% CI, -3.78 to -1.69) in the placebo group. The reduction in PSQI was greater in the escitalopram than in the placebo group at week 8 (mean difference, -1.31; 95% CI, -2.14 to -0.49; P < 0.001 overall treatment effect). Clinical improvement in insomnia symptoms and subjective sleep quality (\xe2\x89\xa550% decreases in ISI and PSQI from baseline) was observed more frequently in the escitalopram group than in the placebo group (ISI, 50.0% vs 35.4%, P = 0.04; PSQI, 29.6% vs 19.2%, P = 0.09).Among healthy perimenopausal and postmenopausal women with hot flashes, escitalopram at 10 to 20 mg/day compared with placebo reduced insomnia symptoms and improved subjective sleep quality at 8 weeks of follow-up.'

aS'Recent reports have noted higher rates of heterotopic ossification (HO) with surface replacement arthroplasty (SRA) than with traditional total hip arthroplasty in the absence of postoperative HO prophylaxis. This study reports rates and grades of HO in 44 SRA patients with at least 1 year of follow-up. Heterotopic ossification prophylaxis was used in 32 (73%) of 44 cases. Heterotopic ossification prophylaxis consisted of radiotherapy (22/32), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (8/32), or both (2/32). One case of clinically significant HO was documented in the no-prophylaxis group. This strategy of selective HO prophylaxis in patients felt by orthopedic surgeons to be at high risk of HO resulted in low rates of clinically relevant HO after SRA (1/44, 2.3%). Further study is needed to establish optimal selection criteria for HO prophylaxis after SRA.'

We previously examined a once-daily continuous dosing schedule of vorinostat in combination with bortezomib which was well tolerated in cycles 1 and 2; however, there was concern regarding the tolerability through multiple cycles. This study was conducted to evaluate an intermittent dosing schedule of vorinostat with bortezomib.Vorinostat was initially administered orally twice daily on days 1-14 with bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 21 day cycle. Two DLTs (elevated ALT and fatigue) were observed at dose level 1, thus the protocol was amended to administer vorinostat intermittently twice daily on days 1-4 and 8-11.29 patients were enrolled; 13 men and 16 women. Common cancer types included sarcoma, pancreatic, colorectal, GIST, and breast. The most common Grade 3-4 toxicities at any dose level included thrombocytopenia, fatigue, increased ALT, elevated INR, and diarrhea. DLTs in the intermittent dosing scheduled included thrombocytopenia and fatigue. The Cmax and AUC for the intermittent dosing regimen were similar to those observed in the daily dosing. In this heavily pretreated population, stable disease was observed in patients with sarcoma, colorectal adenocarcinoma and GIST.The MTD was established at vorinostat 300 mg BID on days 1-4 and 8-11 and bortezomib 1.3 mg/m(2) IV on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 21 day cycle. Tolerability was not improved with the intermittent dosing schedule of vorinostat when compared to continuous dosing.'

aS'Untreated HIV may increase the risk of cardiovascular events. Our preliminary in vitro and in vivo research suggests that pentoxifylline (PTX) reduces vascular inflammation and improves endothelial function in HIV-infected persons not requiring antiretroviral therapy.We performed a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of PTX 400 mg orally thrice daily for 8 weeks in 26 participants. The primary endpoint was change in flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery after 8 weeks. Nitroglycerin-mediated dilation (NTGMD) and circulating markers of inflammation, cellular immune activation, coagulation, and metabolism were also assessed.The difference in mean absolute change (SD) in FMD after 8 weeks between the placebo [-1.06 (1.45)%] and PTX [-1.93 (3.03)%] groups was not significant (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a0.44). No differences in NTGMD were observed. The only significant between-group difference in the changes in biomarkers from baseline to week 8 was in soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (sTNFRI) [-83.2 pg/mL in the placebo group vs. +65.9 pg/mL in the PTX group; P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a0.03]. PTX was generally well-tolerated.PTX did not improve endothelial function and unexpectedly increased the inflammatory biomarker sTNFRI in HIV-infected participants not requiring antiretroviral therapy. Additional interventional research is needed to reduce inflammation and cardiovascular risk in this population.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00796822.'

aS"To report our institution's experience using prone positioning for three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) to deliver post-lumpectomy whole breast irradiation (WBI) in a cohort of women with large and/or pendulous breasts, to determine the rate of acute and late toxicities and, more specifically, cosmetic outcomes. We hypothesized that using 3D-CRT for WBI in the prone position would reduce or eliminate patient and breast size as negative prognostic indicators for toxicities associated with WBI.From 1998 to 2006, 110 cases were treated with prone WBI using 3D-CRT. The lumpectomy, breast target volumes, heart, and lung were contoured on all computed tomography scans. A dose of 45-50 Gy was prescribed to the breast volume using standard fractionation schemes. The planning goals were \xe2\x89\xa595% of prescription to 95% of the breast volume, and 100% of boost dose to 95% of lumpectomy planning target volume. Toxicities and cosmesis were prospectively scored using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Effects Version 3.0 and the Harvard Scale. The median follow-up was 40 months.The median body mass index (BMI) was 33.6 kg/m(2), and median breast volume was 1396 cm(3). The worst toxicity encountered during radiation was Grade 3 dermatitis in 5% of our patient population. Moist desquamation occurred in 16% of patients, with only 2% of patients with moist desquamation outside the inframammary/axillary folds. Eleven percent of patients had Grade \xe2\x89\xa52 late toxicities, including Grade 3 induration/fibrosis in 2%. Excellent to good cosmesis was achieved in 89%. Higher BMI was associated with moist desquamation and breast pain, but BMI and breast volume did not impact fibrosis or excellent to good cosmesis.In patients with higher BMI and/or large-pendulous breasts, delivering prone WBI using 3D-CRT results in favorable toxicity profiles and high excellent to good cosmesis rates. Higher BMI was associated with moist desquamation, but prone positioning removed BMI and breast size as factors for poorer cosmetic outcomes. This series adds to the growing literature demonstrating that prone WBI may be advantageous in select patients."

aS'Upper extremity (UE) hemiparesis persists after stroke, limiting hand function. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is an effective intervention to improve UE recovery, although the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Our objective was to establish a reliable protocol to measure UE agonist-antagonist forearm monosynaptic reflexes in a pilot study to determine if NMES improves wrist function after stroke. We established the between-day reliability of the H-reflex in the extensor carpi radialis longus (ECRL) and flexor carpi radialis (FCR) musculature for individuals with prior stroke (n=18). The same-day generation of ECRL/FCR H-reflex recruitment curves was well tolerated, regardless of age or UE spasticity. The between-day reliability of the ECRL H-reflex was enhanced above FCR, similar to healthy subjects [20], with the Hmax the most reliable parameter quantified in both muscles. H-reflex and functional measures following NMES show the potential for NMES-induced increases in ECRL Hmax, but confirmation requires a larger clinical study. Our initial results support the safe, easy, and efficacious use of in-home NMES, and establish a potential method to measure UE monosynaptic reflexes after stroke.'

aS'The optimal protocol for the detection and treatment of postthyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism is unknown. We sought to identify and treat patients at risk for symptomatic hypocalcemia on the basis of a single parathyroid hormone (PTH) obtained the morning after surgery (POD1).We performed a prospective, randomized study of total thyroidectomy patients who had POD1 calcium and PTH (pg/mL) levels. Randomization was determined by POD1 PTH: if \xe2\x89\xa5 10, patients received no supplementation unless symptomatic; if <10, patients were randomized to calcium, calcium and calcitriol, or no supplementation.Of 143 patients, 112 (78%) had a POD1 PTH \xe2\x89\xa5 10. Hypocalcemic symptoms were transiently reported in 11 (10%) and managed with outpatient calcium. Of 31 patients with PTH <10, 15 (48%) developed symptoms, including 5 who required intravenous calcium. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, when we adjusted for postoperative calcium level and performance of central neck dissection, we found that predictors of hypocalcemic symptoms were younger age (odds ratio 1.59, 95% confidence interval 1.07-2.32) and a PTH <10 (odds ratio 1.08, 95% confidence interval 1.04-1.12). There were no patient or treatment-related factors that predicted a POD1 PTH <10.A single POD1 PTH level <10 can accurately identify those patients at risk for clinically significant hypocalcemia. All total thyroidectomy patients with a postoperative PTH \xe2\x89\xa5 10 can be safely discharged without supplementation. Given the small number of patients with PTH <10, it is unclear whether both calcium and calcitriol are needed for these higher-risk patients.'

aS'Presentation in shock and preoperative infection remain risk factors for neonatal cardiac surgery. This report describes bilateral pulmonary artery banding (bPAB) in ductal-dependent lesions with systemic outflow obstruction as rescue intervention before surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass in these high-risk neonates.A retrospective chart review was conducted for 10 patients who underwent bPAB before conventional surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Patient characteristics including birth weight, gestational age, cardiac and noncardiac diagnoses, preoperative and postoperative markers of organ function, and outcome measures were examined.The majority of patients (8 of 10) were considered high-risk owing to multiorgan dysfunction syndrome. The median age at bPAB was 12 days (range, 5 to 26 days), and the median interval between bPAB and second surgery was 10.5 days (range, 5 to 79 days). Organ function improved after admission and continued to improve after bPAB in 9 of 10 patients. No patient experienced new complications between bPAB and subsequent operation. Of 8 patients who had stage I palliation, 5 have undergone or are awaiting completion Fontan, 1 underwent Kawashima procedure, 1 underwent orthotopic heart transplant, and 1 with hypoplastic left heart syndrome and intact atrial septum died at 44 days old. Both patients who underwent biventricular repair are alive and well. Median follow-up for survivors was 2.9 years (range, 0.25 to 6.25 years).Bilateral pulmonary artery banding is safe in ductal-dependent lesions with systemic outflow obstruction. High-risk patients with preoperative organ dysfunction or infection can recover within a short period and become lower risk candidates for complex congenital heart surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass.'

aS'Endothelial dysfunction in childhood obesity may precede cerebrovascular damage and cognitive impairment in adulthood. A noninvasive proxy of microvascular health is required to identify the risk for microvascular damage in obese children.The associations of hippocampal volumes and global cerebral atrophy were assessed with retinal vessel caliber in 40 normal BMI controls and 62 obese age-matched nondiabetic adolescents and the contribution of inflammation, obesity, and insulin resistance to retinal vessel caliber was evaluated.Compared to controls, obese adolescents had smaller retinal arterioles (8.3% decrease, P < 0.05) and wider venules (5.4% increase, P < 0.01). Larger retinal arteriole diameters were associated with less global cerebral atrophy (B = -0.24 [95% confidence interval, CI: -0.48, -0.002]) and larger hippocampal volumes (B = 0.01 [95% CI: 0, 0.02]). Venule diameters (B = 84.2 [95% CI: 30.3, 138.1]) were predicted by inflammation (fibrinogen). Arteriolar diameters were predicted by insulin resistance, indicated by logHOMA (homeostatic model assessment, HOMA) values (B = -17.03 [95% CI: -28.25, -5.81)] and body mass index (BMI) (B = -.67 [95% CI: -1.09, -0.24)]. All analyses were adjusted for mean arterial pressure, sleep apnea, and vessel diameter.Measures of brain health, BMI, and insulin resistance are associated with retinal vessel caliber. If confirmed in larger studies, retinal arteriolar caliber may serve as a possible noninvasive proxy for brain atrophy in obese adolescents, and the identification of elevated risk for cerebral microvascular disease in adulthood.'

aS'We describe an integrative psychotherapy for first responders to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack, including those who continue to be psychologically impacted by these events, most of whom meet criteria for a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder. Three core techniques used in this treatment are described: (a) an emphasis on meaning making, particularly regarding the traumatic event; (b) focus on the most affect-laden components of the traumatic exposure; and (c) identifying and challenging the implicit strategies used by individuals to avoid discussion of components of their traumatic memories and the attendant negative affect. For each intervention, a theoretical rationale and the presumed mechanism of operation are presented. We discuss the clinical and research implications of this intervention.'

aS'This pilot study examines whether a novel diabetes screening approach using gingival crevicular blood (GCB) could be used to test for hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) during periodontal visits.Finger-stick blood (FSB) samples from 120 patients and GCB samples from those patients with adequate bleeding on probing (BOP) were collected on special blood collection cards and analyzed for HbA1c levels in a laboratory. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to measure correlation between FSB and GCB HbA1c values for 75 paired FSB and GCB samples. A receiver-operator characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was performed to determine an optimal GCB HbA1c criterion value for a positive diabetes screen.For the 75 paired samples, the Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.842. The ROC analysis identified a criterion value of 6.3% for the GCB HbA1c test with high sensitivity (0.933) and high specificity (0.900), corresponding to FSB HbA1c values \xe2\x89\xa56.5% (in the diabetes range). Using this GCB HbA1c criterion value for 27 additional paired samples, in which there was an unidentified component observed to coelute within the elution window of GCB HbA1c in the laboratory, there was agreement between FSB and GCB values for 24 of the pairs according to whether both were within or outside of the diabetes range.Using a criterion value of 6.3%, GCB samples are acceptable for HbA1c testing to screen for diabetes in most persons with BOP at the GCB collection site.'

aS"Annual surveillance coronary angiograpyhy to screen for graft coronary vasculopathy is routine practice after orthotopic heart transplantation. Traditionally, this is performed with direct coronary angiography using static single-plane or biplane angiography. Recently, technological advances have made it possible to perform dual-axis rotational coronary angiography (RA). This technique differs from standard static single-plane or biplane angiography in that a single detector is preprogrammed to swing through a complex 80\xc2\xb0 arc during a single injection. It has the advantage of providing a perspective of the vessels from a full arc of images rather than from one or two static images per contrast injection. The current study evaluated two coronary angiography techniques used consecutively at a single center to evaluate pediatric heart transplant recipients for graft coronary vasculopathy. A total of 23 patients underwent routine coronary angiography using both biplane static coronary angiography (BiP) and RA techniques at the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin from February 2009 to September 2010. Demographic and procedure data were collected from each procedure and analyzed for significance utilizing a Wilcoxon rank sum test. No significant demographic or procedural differences between the BiP and the RA procedures were noted. Specific measures of radiation dose including fluoroscopy time and dose area product were similar among the imaging techniques. The findings show that RA can be performed safely and reproducibly in pediatric heart transplant recipients. Compared with standard BiP, RA does not increase radiation exposure or contrast use and in our experience has provided superior angiographic imaging for the evaluation of graft coronary vasculopathy."

aS'Many asthmatic patients exhibit sputum eosinophilia associated with exacerbations. Benralizumab targets eosinophils by binding IL-5 receptor \xce\xb1, inducing apoptosis through antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity.We sought to evaluate the safety of benralizumab in adults with eosinophilic asthma and its effects on eosinophil counts in airway mucosal/submucosal biopsy specimens, sputum, bone marrow, and peripheral blood.In this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase I study, 13 subjects were randomized to single-dose intravenous placebo or 1 mg/kg benralizumab (day 0; cohort 1), and 14 subjects were randomized to 3 monthly subcutaneous doses of placebo or 100 or 200 mg of benralizumab (days 0, 28, and 56; cohort 2). Cohorts 1 and 2 were consecutive.The incidence of adverse events was similar between groups. No serious adverse events related to benralizumab occurred. In cohort 1 intravenous benralizumab produced a median decrease from baseline of 61.9% in airway mucosal eosinophil counts (day 28; placebo: +19.6%; P = .28), as well as an 18.7% decrease (day 21) in sputum and a 100% decrease (day 28) in blood counts. Eosinophils were not detectable in bone marrow of benralizumab-treated subjects (day 28, n = 4). In cohort 2 subcutaneous benralizumab demonstrated a combined (100 + 200 mg) median reduction of 95.8% in airway eosinophil counts (day 84; placebo, 46.7%; P = .06), as well as an 89.9% decrease (day 28) in sputum and a 100% decrease (day 84) in blood counts.Single-dose intravenous and multiple-dose subcutaneous benralizumab reduced eosinophil counts in airway mucosa/submucosa and sputum and suppressed eosinophil counts in bone marrow and peripheral blood. The safety profile supports further development. Additional studies are needed to assess the clinical benefit in asthmatic patients.'

aS'Estrogen inhibition is effective in preventing breast cancer in only up to 50% of women with precancerous lesions and many experience side effects that are poorly tolerated. As insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) underlies both estrogen and progesterone actions and has other direct effects on mammary development and carcinogenesis, we hypothesized that IGF-I inhibition might provide a novel approach for breast cancer chemoprevention.In total, 13 women with core breast biopsies diagnostic of atypical hyperplasia (AH) were treated for 10 days with pasireotide, a somatostatin analog which uniquely inhibits IGF-I action in the mammary gland. They then had excision biopsies. 12 patients also had proliferative lesions and one a ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Primary outcomes were changes in cell proliferation and apoptosis after treatment. Expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and phosphorylated Insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-1R), protein kinase B (AKT) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) were also assessed. Core and excision biopsies from 14 untreated patients served as non-blinded controls. Hyperglycemia and other side effects were carefully monitored.Pasireotide decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis in all AH (from 3.6\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x892.6% to 1.3\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x891.2% and from 0.3\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.2% to 1.5\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x891.6%, respectively) and proliferative lesions (from 3.8\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x892.5% to 1.8\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x891.8% and from 0.3\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.2% to 1.3\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.6%, respectively). The DCIS responded similarly. ER and PR were not affected by pasireotide, while IGF-1R, ERK1/2 and AKT phosphorylation decreased significantly. In contrast, tissue from untreated controls showed no change in cell proliferation or phosphorylation of IGF-1R, AKT or ERK 1/2. Mild to moderate hyperglycemia associated with reduced insulin levels was found. Glucose fell into the normal range after discontinuing treatment. Pasireotide was well tolerated and did not cause symptoms of estrogen deprivation.IGF-I inhibition by pasireotide, acting through the IGF-1R, was associated with decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis in pre-malignant breast lesions and one DCIS. Assuming hyperglycemia can be controlled, these data suggest that inhibiting the IGF-I pathway may prove an effective alternative for breast cancer chemoprevention.NCT01372644 Trial date: July 1, 2007.'

At weeks 1 and 10, MI participants had brief MI sessions; controls viewed health education videos. All participants continued with T.E.E.N.S. (biweekly dietitian and behavioural support visits; 3 times per week supervised physical activity). Assessments were repeated at baseline, 3 and 6 months. T-tests and chi-square analyses examined T.E.E.N.S. attrition and adherence by group.Adolescents (N\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8999) were primarily African-American (73%) females (74%); age\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8913.8\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x891.8 years, body mass index percentile\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8998.0\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x891.2.

aS'The aim of this study was to measure sublingual perfused capillary density (PCD) to assess sublingual microvascular perfusion during emergency department (ED) treatment of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF).This prospective, observational study enrolled ED patients with ADHF, measuring pre- and post-ED treatment PCD. Sidestream dark-field imaging was analyzed by 3 investigators blinded to patient identifiers and time points. Patient demographics, ADHF etiology, serum brain natriuretic peptide, and hemoglobin were measured along with a visual analogue scale (VAS), which assessed patient baseline characteristics and response to ED treatment. A paired t test analyzed changes in PCD, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and patient assessment. Interrater variability was assessed with an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), with a P value <.05 considered significant for all testing.Thirty-six patients were enrolled with a mean time between pretreatment and posttreatment PCD (\xc2\xb1SD) of 138 \xc2\xb1 59 minutes and a hospital length of stay of 4.0 \xc2\xb1 4.1 days. During this time, PCD increased (difference, 1.3 mm/mm(2); 95% confidence interval, 0.4-2.1; P = .004), as did the MAP (P = .002), patient VAS score (P < .001), and observer VAS score (P < .001). There was no correlation between the change in PCD and time (R(2) = .016, P = .47), MAP (R(2) = .013, P = .54), or VAS scores. The ICC was 0.954.Sublingual tissue perfusion is diminished in ADHF but increases with treatment. It may represent a quantitative way to evaluate ADHF in the ED setting.'

aS'Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is an inherited form of developmental disability and a single gene cause of autism. As a disorder with increasingly understood pathophysiology, FXS is a model form of developmental disability for targeted drug development efforts. Preclinical animal model findings have focused targeted drug treatment development in FXS on an imbalance between excessive glutamate and deficient gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission.We conducted a prospective open-label 10-week trial of acamprosate in 12 youth aged 6-17 years (mean age: 11.9 years) with FXS.Acamprosate use (mean dose: 1,054 \xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1 \xe2\x80\x89422 mg/day) was associated with treatment response (defined by a Clinical Global Impressions Improvement (CGI-I) scale score of "very much improved" or "much improved") in nine of 12 (75 %) subjects. Improvement was noted in social behavior and inattention/hyperactivity using multiple standard behavioral outcome measures. No significant adverse effects or changes in vital signs, including weight or laboratory measures, occurred during treatment with acamprosate. Additionally, pre- and post-treatment blood biomarker analyses looking at brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels found a significant increase in BDNF with treatment. In our pilot sample, treatment response did not correlate with change in BDNF with treatment.Acamprosate was generally safe and well tolerated and was associated with a significant improvement in social behavior and a reduction in inattention/hyperactivity. The increase in BDNF that occurred with treatment may be a useful pharmacodynamic marker in future acamprosate studies. Given these findings, a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of acamprosate in youth with FXS is warranted.'

aS'Sunitinib treatment results in a compensatory increase in plasma VEGF levels. Acute withdrawal of sunitinib results in a proliferative withdrawal flare, primarily due to elevated VEGF levels. Concurrent sunitinib plus bevacizumab is poorly tolerated with high (37 %) incidence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA). We evaluated a sequential design administering bevacizumab during the sunitinib treatment break to suppress the sunitinib withdrawal flare.Patients with no prior VEGF treatment were enrolled in this study. All patients had target lesions amenable to serial FLT PET/CT imaging. Sunitinib 37.5 mg was given on days 1-28 every 6 weeks with bevacizumab 5 mg/kg on day 29. If safe and tolerable, sunitinib increased to 50 mg. FLT PET/CT scans would be obtained at baseline (D1), week 4, and week 6 to evaluate pharmacodynamics of the sequential combination. Sunitinib pharmacokinetics and total, free, and bound VEGF levels were obtained on each cycle at D1, pre-bevacizumab (D29), 4 h post-bevacizumab (D29H4), and day 42 (D42).Six patients enrolled in the safety cohort of sunitinib 37.5 mg plus bevacizumab (see Table). One patient experienced grade 1 MAHA, and after discussion with the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP), the trial was closed to further accrual. No imaging scans were obtained due to early closure. Total and free VEGF levels during cycle 1 Cycle 1 Total VEGF (pg/mL) Mean \xc2\xb1 SD Free VEGF (pg/mL) Mean \xc2\xb1 SD D1 80 \xc2\xb1 70 51 \xc2\xb1 47 D29 150 \xc2\xb1 62 103 \xc2\xb1 35 D29H4 10 \xc2\xb1 12 2 \xc2\xb1 5 D42 177 \xc2\xb1 34 97 \xc2\xb1 18 CONCLUSIONS: Subclinical MAHA was seen despite using sequential sunitinib with low-dose bevacizumab, and this combination was not feasible for further development. As predicted, VEGF levels increased during sunitinib exposure followed by a rapid decline after bevacizumab. Due to the long half-life of bevacizumab, we expected VEGF ligand suppression through D42, but instead observed a complete rebound in total/free VEGF levels by D42. The increase in VEGF at D42 was unexpected based on sunitinib alone and contrary to the hypothesis that we would block VEGF flare with low-dose bevacizumab. VEGF ligand production may increase as a result of bevacizumab, implying a robust host compensatory mechanism to VEGF signaling pathway inhibition. A greater understanding of the compensatory mechanism would aid future sequencing strategies of new agents.'

aS'To date, placebo-controlled drug trials targeting the core social impairment of autistic disorder (autism) have had uniformly negative results. Given this, the search for new potentially novel agents targeting the core social impairment of autism continues. Acamprosate is U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved drug to treat alcohol dependence. The drug likely impacts both gamma-aminobutyric acid and glutamate neurotransmission. This study describes our initial open-label experience with acamprosate targeting social impairment in youth with autism. In this naturalistic report, five of six youth (mean age, 9.5 years) were judged treatment responders to acamprosate (mean dose 1,110 mg/day) over 10 to 30 weeks (mean duration, 20 weeks) of treatment. Acamprosate was well tolerated with only mild gastrointestinal adverse effects noted in three (50%) subjects.'

aS'Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of developmental disability and most common single gene cause of autism. Persons with FXS frequently exhibit irritable behavior marked by aggression, self-injury, and severe tantrums. Despite frequent clinical use of atypical antipsychotic drugs to target this behavioral cluster, no systematic trials to date have assessed the efficacy and safety of these drugs in persons with FXS.We conducted a prospective open-label 12-week trial of aripiprazole in 12 persons aged 6-25 years (mean age, 14.3 years) with FXS who were free of concomitant psychoactive drugs.Aripiprazole use (mean dose, 9.8 mg/day) was associated with treatment response (defined by a Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale score of much improved or very much improved and a \xe2\x89\xa5 25% improvement on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Irritability subscale) in 10 of 12 (87%) persons. Two individuals (13%) discontinued aripiprazole prior to study completion due to adverse events. One discontinuation was due to akathisia, mild drooling, and mild tiredness and the other due to moderate tiredness and moderate drooling. No significant changes in vital signs including weight or laboratory measures occurred during treatment with aripiprazole.Aripiprazole was generally safe and well tolerated and was associated with significant improvement in irritable behavior. Given these findings, a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of aripiprazole in FXS is warranted.'

Common laboratory abnormalities included transient, asymptomatic lymphopenia, hyperglycemia, anemia, hypoalbuminemia, and bilirubin and liver enzyme elevations. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. Biologic effects of rhIL-18 included transient lymphopenia and increased expression of activation antigens on lymphocytes. Increases in serum concentrations of IFN-\xce\xb3, GM-CSF, and chemokines were observed after dosing. Objective tumor responses were seen in 5 patients, including 2 complete and 3 partial responses. rhIL-18 can be given in biologically active doses by weekly infusions in combination with rituximab to patients with lymphoma. A maximum tolerated dose of rhIL-18 plus rituximab was not determined. Further studies of rhIL-18 and CD20 monoclonal antibodies in B-cell malignancies are warranted.'

aS'The innate proatherosclerotic properties of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors have not previously been examined. Therefore, we performed a pilot study of etravirine (ETR) in healthy volunteers over 28 days. This investigation also allowed us to evaluate the safety of ETR over a period commonly used for HIV postexposure prophylaxis. ETR 200 mg twice daily was given to 28 healthy HIV-uninfected volunteers over 28 days. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery and circulating markers of inflammation, coagulation, and metabolism were measured at entry and at day 28. These circulating markers were also measured at day 35. Of the initial 28 subjects, 23 completed both entry and day 28 procedures. Two subjects were discontinued due to development of rash. No other major toxicities developed. The change in FMD over 28 days was minimal and not significant (0.03 [-3.21, 0.97] %; p=0.36). The post hoc estimated detectable absolute change in FMD with the 23 subjects in our study was 2.26%, which is an effect size that has been associated with future cardiovascular event rates in the general population; thus our study had sufficient power to find clinically relevant changes in FMD. In addition, there were no significant changes in any of the circulating markers from entry to day 28 or from day 28 to day 35. ETR did not demonstrate any innate proatherosclerotic properties over 28 days in these HIV-uninfected volunteers. ETR was generally well tolerated. Larger studies are warranted to confirm that ETR can be used safely as part of HIV postexposure prophylaxis regimens.'

aS'Mechanisms for increased cardiovascular risk in HIV-1-infected adults are incompletely understood, but platelet activation and immune activation leading to a prothrombotic state have been proposed as significant contributors. Aspirin has antiplatelet and immunomodulatory properties. We explored whether 1 week of low-dose aspirin attenuates platelet activation and immune activation in HIV-1-infected and virologically suppressed adults on antiretroviral therapy.Platelet activation and immune activation were measured in HIV-1-infected subjects virologically suppressed on antiretroviral therapy and controls before and after 1 week of low-dose aspirin.Compared with control subjects, HIV-1-infected subjects had increased platelet activation, as measured by spontaneous platelet aggregation and aggregation in response to adenosine diphosphate, collagen, and arachidonic acid. After aspirin therapy, percent aggregation decreased similarly in both HIV-1-infected and control subjects to all platelet agonists tested except aggregation in response to arachidonic acid, which remained elevated in the HIV-1-infected group. HIV-1-infected subjects exhibited increased markers of T-cell activation (CD38 and HLA-DR) and monocyte activation (sCD14), which decreased after 1 week of aspirin therapy. Moreover, leukocyte responses to Toll-like receptor stimulation were enhanced after 1 week of aspirin therapy. In vitro studies showed that HIV-1 plasma could activate healthy platelets, which in turn activated monocytes, implicating a direct role for activated platelets in immune activation.Our data demonstrate that heightened platelet activation and immune activation in treated HIV-1 disease are attenuated by 1 week of aspirin therapy. Aspirin should be further studied for its antithrombotic and immunomodulatory benefits in treated HIV-1 disease.'

aS'An excitatory/inhibitory (E:I) imbalance marked by enhanced glutamate and deficient gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission may contribute to the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorders (ASD).We report on the first single-blind placebo lead-in trial of acamprosate, a drug with putative mechanisms restoring E:I imbalance, in twelve youth with ASD.We conducted a 12-week single-blind, placebo lead-in study of acamprosate in youth age 5-17 years with autistic disorder.Six of nine subjects who received active drug treatment were deemed treatment responders (defined by a score at final visit of "very much improved" or "much improved" on the Clinical Global Impressions Improvement scale) and \xe2\x89\xa525% improvement on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist Social Withdrawal subscale.Future larger-scale dose finding studies of acamprosate in ASD may be warranted given this preliminary indication of benefit.'

aS'Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) represents a dysfunctional gut-liver-brain axis in cirrhosis which can negatively impact outcomes. This altered gut-brain relationship has been treated using gut-selective antibiotics such as rifaximin, that improve cognitive function in HE, especially its subclinical form, minimal HE (MHE). However, the precise mechanism of the action of rifaximin in MHE is unclear. We hypothesized that modulation of gut microbiota and their end-products by rifaximin would affect the gut-brain axis and improve cognitive performance in cirrhosis. Aim To perform a systems biology analysis of the microbiome, metabolome and cognitive change after rifaximin in MHE.Twenty cirrhotics with MHE underwent cognitive testing, endotoxin analysis, urine/serum metabolomics (GC and LC-MS) and fecal microbiome assessment (multi-tagged pyrosequencing) at baseline and 8 weeks post-rifaximin 550 mg BID. Changes in cognition, endotoxin, serum/urine metabolites (and microbiome were analyzed using recommended systems biology techniques. Specifically, correlation networks between microbiota and metabolome were analyzed before and after rifaximin.There was a significant improvement in cognition(six of seven tests improved, p<0.01) and endotoxemia (0.55 to 0.48 Eu/ml, p\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a0.02) after rifaximin. There was a significant increase in serum saturated (myristic, caprylic, palmitic, palmitoleic, oleic and eicosanoic) and unsaturated (linoleic, linolenic, gamma-linolenic and arachnidonic) fatty acids post-rifaximin. No significant microbial change apart from a modest decrease in Veillonellaceae and increase in Eubacteriaceae was observed. Rifaximin resulted in a significant reduction in network connectivity and clustering on the correlation networks. The networks centered on Enterobacteriaceae, Porphyromonadaceae and Bacteroidaceae indicated a shift from pathogenic to beneficial metabolite linkages and better cognition while those centered on autochthonous taxa remained similar.Rifaximin is associated with improved cognitive function and endotoxemia in MHE, which is accompanied by alteration of gut bacterial linkages with metabolites without significant change in microbial abundance.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01069133.'

aS'To compare bariatric surgery versus intensive medical weight management (MWM) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who do not meet current National Institutes of Health criteria for bariatric surgery and to assess whether the soluble form of receptor for advanced glycation end products (sRAGE) is a biomarker to identify patients most likely to benefit from surgery.There are few studies comparing surgery to MWM for patients with T2DM and BMI less than 35.Fifty-seven patients with T2DM and BMI 30 to 35, who otherwise met the criteria for bariatric surgery were randomized to MWM versus surgery (bypass, sleeve or band, based on patient preference). The primary outcomes assessed at 6 months were change in homeostatic model of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and diabetes remission. Secondary outcomes included changes in HbA1c, weight, and sRAGE.The surgery group had improved HOMA-IR (-4.6 vs +1.6; P = 0.0004) and higher diabetes remission (65% vs 0%, P < 0.0001) than the MWM group at 6 months. Compared to MWM, the surgery group had lower HbA1c (6.2 vs 7.8, P = 0.002), lower fasting glucose (99.5 vs 157; P = 0.0068), and fewer T2DM medication requirements (20% vs 88%; P < 0.0001) at 6 months. The surgery group lost more weight (7. vs 1.0 BMI decrease, P < 0.0001). Higher baseline sRAGE was associated with better weight loss outcomes (r = -0.641; P = 0.046). There were no mortalities.Surgery was very effective short-term in patients with T2DM and BMI 30 to 35. Baseline sRAGE may predict patients most likely to benefit from surgery. These findings need to be confirmed with larger studies.ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT01423877.'

aS'To evaluate the effects of escitalopram 10-20 mg/day on menopause-related quality of life and pain in healthy menopausal women with hot flashes.A double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial of escitalopram 10-20mg/day vs. identical placebo was conducted among 205 women ages 40-62 years with an average of \xe2\x89\xa54 daily hot flashes recruited at 4 clinical sites from July 2009 to June 2010.The primary trial outcomes, reported previously, were the frequency and severity of vasomotor symptoms at 8 weeks. Here, we report on the pre-specified secondary endpoints of total and domain scores from the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (MENQOL) and the pain intensity and interference scale (PEG).Outcome data were collected on 97% of randomized women and 87% of women took at least 70% of their study medication. Treatment with escitalopram resulted in significantly greater improvement in total MENQOL scores (mean difference at 8 weeks of -0.41; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.71 to -0.11; p<0.001), as well as Vasomotor, Psychosocial, and Physical domain scores with the largest difference seen in the Vasomotor domain (mean difference -0.75; 95% CI -1.28 to -0.22; p=0.02). There was no significant treatment group difference for the Sexual Function domain. Escitalopram treatment resulted in statistically significant improvements in PEG scores compared to placebo (mean treatment group difference at 8 weeks of -0.33; 95% CI -0.81 to 0.15; p=0.045).Treatment with escitalopram 10-20mg/day in healthy women with vasomotor symptoms significantly improved menopause-related quality of life and pain.'

aS"OBJECTIVE We previously reported that 2 years of costimulation modulation with abatacept slowed decline of \xce\xb2-cell function in recent-onset type 1 diabetes (T1D). Subsequently, abatacept was discontinued and subjects were followed to determine whether there was persistence of effect. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Of 112 subjects (ages 6-36 years) with T1D, 77 received abatacept and 35 received placebo infusions intravenously for 27 infusions over 2 years. The primary outcome-baseline-adjusted geometric mean 2-h area under the curve (AUC) serum C-peptide during a mixed-meal tolerance test (MMTT) at 2 years-showed higher C-peptide with abatacept versus placebo. Subjects were followed an additional year, off treatment, with MMTTs performed at 30 and 36 months. RESULTS C-peptide AUC means, adjusted for age and baseline C-peptide, at 36 months were 0.217 nmol/L (95% CI 0.168-0.268) and 0.141 nmol/L (95% CI 0.071-0.215) for abatacept and placebo groups, respectively (P = 0.046). The C-peptide decline from baseline remained parallel with an estimated 9.5 months' delay with abatacept. Moreover, HbA1c levels remained lower in the abatacept group than in the placebo group. The slightly lower (nonsignificant) mean total insulin dose among the abatacept group reported at 2 years was the same as the placebo group by 3 years. CONCLUSIONS Costimulation modulation with abatacept slowed decline of \xce\xb2-cell function and improved HbA1c in recent-onset T1D. The beneficial effect was sustained for at least 1 year after cessation of abatacept infusions or 3 years from T1D diagnosis."

aS"Velaglucerase alfa is a glucocerebrosidase produced by gene activation technology in a human fibroblast cell line (HT-1080), and it is indicated as an enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for the treatment of Gaucher disease type 1 (GD1). This multicenter, open-label, 12-month study examined the safety and efficacy of velaglucerase alfa in patients with GD1 previously receiving imiglucerase. Eligible patients, \xe2\x89\xa52 years old and clinically stable on imiglucerase therapy, were switched to velaglucerase alfa at a dose equal to their prior imiglucerase dose. Infusion durations were 1 hr every other week. Forty patients received velaglucerase alfa (18 male, 22 female; four previously splenectomized; age range 9-71 years). Velaglucerase alfa was generally well tolerated with most adverse events (AEs) of mild or moderate severity. The three most frequently reported AEs were headache (12 of 40 patients), arthralgia (9 of 40 patients), and nasopharyngitis (8 of 40 patients). No patients developed antibodies to velaglucerase alfa. There was one serious AE considered treatment-related: a grade 2 anaphylactoid reaction within 30 min of the first infusion. The patient withdrew; this was the only AE-related withdrawal. Hemoglobin concentrations, platelet counts, and spleen and liver volumes remained stable through 12 months. In conclusion, adult and pediatric patients with GD1, previously treated with imiglucerase, successfully transitioned to velaglucerase alfa, which was generally well tolerated and demonstrated efficacy over 12 months' treatment consistent with that observed in the velaglucerase alfa phase 3 clinical trial program."

aS'Type 1 diabetes results from autoimmune targeting of the pancreatic \xce\xb2 cells, likely mediated by effector memory T (Tem) cells. CD2, a T cell surface protein highly expressed on Tem cells, is targeted by the fusion protein alefacept, depleting Tem cells and central memory T (Tcm) cells. We postulated that alefacept would arrest autoimmunity and preserve residual \xce\xb2 cells in patients newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.The T1DAL study is a phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with type 1 diabetes, aged 12-35 years who, within 100 days of diagnosis, were enrolled at 14 US sites. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive alefacept (two 12-week courses of 15 mg intramuscularly per week, separated by a 12-week pause) or a placebo. Randomisation was stratified by site, and was computer-generated with permuted blocks of three patients per block. All participants and site personnel were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in mean 2 h C-peptide area under the curve (AUC) at 12 months. Secondary endpoints at 12 months were the change from baseline in the 4 h C-peptide AUC, insulin use, major hypoglycaemic events, and HbA1c concentrations. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00965458.Of 73 patients assessed for eligibility, 33 were randomly assigned to receive alefacept and 16 to receive placebo. The mean 2 h C-peptide AUC at 12 months increased by 0.015 nmol/L (95% CI -0.080 to 0.110) in the alefacept group and decreased by 0.115 nmol/L (-0.278 to 0.047) in the placebo group, and the difference between groups was not significant (p=0.065). However, key secondary endpoints were met: the mean 4 h C-peptide AUC was significantly higher (mean increase of 0.015 nmol/L [95% CI -0.076 to 0.106] vs decrease of -0.156 nmol/L [-0.305 to -0.006]; p=0.019), and daily insulin use (0.48 units per kg per day for placebo vs 0.36 units per kg per day for alefacept; p=0.02) and the rate of hypoglycaemic events (mean of 10.9 events per person per year for alefacept vs 17.3 events for placebo; p<0.0001) was significantly lower at 12 months in the alefacept group than in the placebo group. Mean HbA1c concentrations at week 52 were not different between treatment groups (p=0.75). So far, no serious adverse events were reported and all patients had at least one adverse event. In the alefacept group, 29 (88%) participants had an adverse event related to study drug versus 15 (94%) participants in the placebo group. In the alefacept group, 14 (42%) participants had grade 3 or 4 adverse events compared with nine (56%) participants in the placebo group; no deaths occurred.Although the primary outcome was not met, at 12 months, alefacept preserved the 4 h C-peptide AUC, lowered insulin use, and reduced hypoglycaemic events, suggesting efficacy. Safety and tolerability were similar in the alefacept and placebo groups. Alefacept could be useful to preserve \xce\xb2-cell function in patients with new-onset type 1 diabetes.'

aS'To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of SB-743921 when administered as a 1-h infusion every 21 days to patients with advanced solid tumors or relapsed/refractory lymphoma.Patients who failed prior standard therapy or those without any standard options were eligible. Forty-four patients were enrolled using an initial accelerated dose-escalation phase followed by a standard dose-escalation phase. An additional 20 patients were enrolled at the recommended phase II dose to obtain additional safety and pharmacokinetic data. The doses evaluated ranged from 2 to 8 mg/m(2). The pharmacokinetics of SB-743921 was evaluated at 19 time-points over 48 h following during administration during cycle 1. Toxicity was assessed by the NCI Common Terminology Criteria version 3.0. Response evaluation was performed every 6 weeks.The most common and consistent DLT was neutropenia. Other DLTs observed included hypophosphatemia, pulmonary emboli, SVC syndrome, transaminitis, hyponatremia, and hyperbilirubinemia. The MTD of SB-743921 as a 1-h infusion every 21 days was established as 4 mg/m(2). The maximum plasma concentration and area under the plasma concentration time curve appeared to increase proportionally to dose. One durable objective response was seen in a patient with metastatic cholangiocarcinoma who was on treatment 11 months and 6 patients had stable disease for over four cycles.The recommended phase II dose of SB-743921 on this specific schedule of a 1-h infusion every 3 weeks is 4 mg/m(2). The promising efficacy and lack of severe toxicities in this study warrant the continued development of SB-743921.'

aS'To assess associations of soluble IL-2 receptor alpha (sIL-2r\xce\xb1) concentration with outcomes in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in a phase 3 trial of IL-2 therapy.We randomized 289 children with AML in first remission after intensive chemotherapy to receive IL-2 infused on days 0-3 and 8-17 (IL-2 group) or no further therapy (AML control group). We measured sequential serum sIL-2r\xce\xb1 concentrations in both groups before, during and after therapy in both groups and in reference controls without AML.Before treatment, mean sIL-2r\xce\xb1 concentrations were similar in the IL-2 group and AML controls, but significantly higher than in reference controls. Both AML groups experienced reduction in sIL-2r\xce\xb1 concentration after chemotherapy. Thereafter in the IL-2 group, mean sIL-2r\xce\xb1 concentration increased from 2,669\xe2\x80\x89pg/ml before IL-2 to 15,534\xe2\x80\x89pg/ml on day 4 (P\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.001) and 10,585\xe2\x80\x89pg/ml on day 18 (P\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.001). In the control group sIL-2r\xce\xb1 concentration did not change after 28 days of follow-up. Five-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 51% in the IL-2 group and 58% in the controls (P = 0.489) and overall survival was 70% and 73%, respectively (P = 0.727).SIL-2r\xce\xb1 concentration was elevated in AML at diagnosis and tended to normalize after chemotherapy. IL-2 infusion significantly increased sIL-2r\xce\xb1 concentration, but did not improve DFS or survival in pediatric AML. Furthermore, sIL-2r\xce\xb1 concentration was not predictive of outcome before, during or after treatment for AML.'

aS'We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with targeted oral busulfan (BU) and cyclophosphamide (CY) in a phase II study. Busulfan (1.0 mg/kg) was given initially in six doses. Based on the estimated concentration at steady state after the first dose of BU, subsequent (7th-16th) doses were adjusted to obtain a targeted overall concentration at steady state of 700-900 ng/mL. The primary endpoint was 1-year overall survival (OS). Fifty patients were registered and 46 (median age, 53 years; range, 18-62 years) received planned transplant, including 24 with AML, 16 with myelodysplastic syndrome, and six with CML. Fourteen patients were categorized as standard risk. Nineteen patients received transplant from human leukocyte antigen-identical siblings, 27 from unrelated donors. The BU dose required reduction in 32 patients and escalation in six patients. One-year OS was 65% (95% confidence interval, 50-77%). Cumulative incidence of hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome was 11%. One-year transplant-related mortality was 18%. Both OS and transplant-related mortality were favorable in this study, including patients of older age and with high risk diseases. Individual dose adjustment based on BU pharmacokinetics was feasible and effective in the current phase II study. This trial is registered in the University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trial Registry System (UMIN-CTR, ID:C000000156).'

aS"To compare the non-neurological events in children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) and previous stroke enrolled in SWiTCH. The NHLBI-sponsored Phase III multicenter randomized clinical trial stroke with transfusions changing to hydroxyurea (SWiTCH) (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00122980) compared continuation of chronic blood transfusion/iron chelation to switching to hydroxyurea/phlebotomy for secondary stroke prevention and management of iron overload. All randomized children were included in the analysis (intention to treat). The Fisher's Exact test was used to compare the frequency of subjects who experienced at least one SCA-related adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE) in each arm and to compare event rates. One hundred and thirty three subjects, mean age 13 \xc2\xb1 3.9 years (range 5.2-19.0 years) and mean time of 7 years on chronic transfusion at study entry, were randomized and treated. Numbers of subjects experiencing non-neurological AEs were similar in the two treatment arms, including SCA-related events, SCA pain events, and low rates of acute chest syndrome and infection. However, fewer children continuing transfusion/chelation experienced SAEs (P = 0.012), SCA-related SAEs (P = 0.003), and SCA pain SAEs (P = 0.016) as compared to children on the hydroxyurea/phlebotomy arm. The timing of phlebotomy did not influence SAEs. Older age at baseline predicted having at least 1 SCA pain event. Patients with recurrent neurological events during SWiTCH were not more likely to experience pain. In children with SCA and prior stroke, monthly transfusions and daily iron chelation provided superior protection against acute vaso-occlusive pain SAEs when compared to hydroxyurea and monthly phlebotomy."

aS'Electronic screening and brief intervention (e-SBI) approaches for substance use have shown early promise. This trial was designed to replicate previous findings from a single 20-minute e-SBI for drug use among postpartum women. A total of 143 postpartum, primarily low-income African-American women meeting criteria for drug use, were randomly assigned to either a tailored e-SBI or a time-matched control condition. Blinded follow-up evaluation 3- and 6-months following childbirth revealed strong effects for confirmed illicit drug use abstinence at the 3-month observation (OR=3.3, p=.01), as did hair analysis at 6months (OR=4.8, p=.018). Additional primary outcomes suggested small to moderate effect sizes in favor of the e-SBI, but did not reach significance. This result replicates previous findings but fails to show durable effects. Assessment reactivity, e-SBI design, and possible extension of e-SBI via tailored messaging all merit careful consideration.'

aS'Obeticholic acid (OCA; INT-747, 6\xce\xb1-ethyl-chenodeoxycholic acid) is a semisynthetic derivative of the primary human bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid, the natural agonist of the farnesoid X receptor, which is a nuclear hormone receptor that regulates glucose and lipid metabolism. In animal models, OCA decreases insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis.We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept study to evaluate the effects of OCA on insulin sensitivity in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Patients were randomly assigned to groups given placebo (n = 23), 25 mg OCA (n = 20), or 50 mg OCA (n = 21) once daily for 6 weeks. A 2-stage hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic insulin clamp was used to measure insulin sensitivity before and after the 6-week treatment period. We also measured levels of liver enzymes, lipid analytes, fibroblast growth factor 19, 7\xce\xb1-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (a BA precursor), endogenous bile acids, and markers of liver fibrosis.When patients were given a low-dose insulin infusion, insulin sensitivity increased by 28.0% from baseline in the group treated with 25 mg OCA (P = .019) and 20.1% from baseline in the group treated with 50 mg OCA (P = .060). Insulin sensitivity increased by 24.5% (P = .011) in combined OCA groups, whereas it decreased by 5.5% in the placebo group. A similar pattern was observed in patients given a high-dose insulin infusion. The OCA groups had significant reductions in levels of \xce\xb3-glutamyltransferase and alanine aminotransferase and dose-related weight loss. They also had increased serum levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and fibroblast growth factor 19, associated with decreased levels of 7\xce\xb1-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one and endogenous bile acids, indicating activation of farnesoid X receptor. Markers of liver fibrosis decreased significantly in the group treated with 25 mg OCA. Adverse experiences were similar among groups.In this phase 2 trial, administration of 25 or 50 mg OCA for 6 weeks was well tolerated, increased insulin sensitivity, and reduced markers of liver inflammation and fibrosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Longer and larger studies are warranted. ClinicalTrials.gov, Number: NCT00501592.'

aS'Both technical and pathophysiologic factors affect PSR in DSC-MR imaging. We aimed to determine how TE, flip angle (\xce\xb1), and contrast dose impact PSR in high-grade gliomas.We retrospectively computed PSR maps for 22 patients with high-grade gliomas, comparing 3 DSC-MR imaging methods by using single-dose gadodiamide without preload administration: A (n = 7), \xce\xb1 = 35\xc2\xb0, TE = 54 ms; B (n = 5), \xce\xb1 = 72\xc2\xb0, TE = 30 ms; C (n = 10), \xce\xb1 = 90\xc2\xb0, TE = 30 ms. Methods A-C served as preload for subsequent dynamic imaging using method D (method C parameters but with double-dose contrast). We compared first- and second-injection tumor PSR for methods C and D (paired t test) and tumor PSR for both injections grouped by the first-injection acquisition method (3-group nonparametric 1-way ANOVA). We compared PSR in tumor and normal brain for each first- and second-injection method group (paired t test).First-injection PSR in tumor and normal brain differed significantly for methods B (P = .01) and C (P = .05), but not A (P = .71). First-injection tumor PSR increased with T1 weighting with a significant main effect of method groupings (P = .0012), but there was no significant main effect for first-injection normal brain (P = .93), or second-injection tumor (P = .95) or normal brain (P = .13). In patients scanned with methods C and D, first-injection PSR significantly exceeded second-injection PSR for tumor (P = .037) and normal brain (P < .001).PSR strongly depends on the T1 weighting of DSC-MR imaging, including pulse sequence (TE, \xce\xb1) and contrast agent (dose, preload) parameters, with implications for protocol design and the interpretation and comparison of PSR values across tumor types and imaging centers.'

aS'An optimal prostate biopsy in clinical practice is based on a balance among adequate detection of clinically significant prostate cancers (sensitivity), assuredness regarding the accuracy of negative sampling (negative predictive value), limited detection of clinically insignificant cancers and good concordance with whole gland surgical pathology results to allow accurate risk stratification and disease localization for treatment selection. Inherent within this optimization is variation of the core number, location, labeling and processing for pathological evaluation. To date, there is no consensus in this regard. The purpose of this review is to 1) define the optimal number and location of biopsy cores during primary prostate biopsy among men with suspected prostate cancer, 2) define the optimal method of labeling prostate biopsy cores for pathological processing which will provide relevant and necessary clinical information for all potential clinical scenarios, and 3) determine the maximal number of prostate biopsy cores allowable within a specimen jar which would not preclude accurate histological evaluation of the tissue.A bibliographic search using PubMed\xc2\xae covering the period up to July 2012 yielded approximately 550 articles. Articles were reviewed and categorized based on which of the 3 objectives of this review was addressed. Data were extracted, analyzed and summarized. Recommendations are provided based on this literature review and our clinical experience.The use of 10 to 12-core extended sampling protocols increases cancer detection rates compared to traditional sextant sampling methods and reduces the likelihood of repeat biopsy by increasing negative predictive value, ultimately allowing more accurate risk stratification without increasing the likelihood of detecting insignificant cancers. As the number of cores increases above 12, the increase in diagnostic yield becomes marginal. Only limited evidence supports the use of initial biopsy schemes involving more than 12 cores or saturation. Apical and laterally directed sampling of the peripheral zone increases cancer detection rate, reduces the need for repeat biopsies and predicts pathological features on prostatectomy while transition zone biopsies do not. There are little data to suggest that knowing the exact site of an individual positive biopsy core provides meaningful clinical information. However, determining laterality of cancer on biopsy may be helpful for predicting sites of extracapsular extension and therapeutic planning. Placement of multiple biopsy cores in a single container (greater than 2) appears to compromise pathological evaluation, which can reduce cancer detection rate and increase the likelihood of equivocal diagnoses.A 12-core systematic biopsy that incorporates apical and far-lateral cores in the template distribution allows maximal cancer detection, avoids repeat biopsy, and provides information adequate for identifying men who need therapy and planning that therapy while minimizing the detection of occult, indolent prostate cancers. This literature review does not provide compelling evidence that individual site specific labeling of cores benefits clinical decision making regarding the management of prostate cancer. Based on the available literature, we recommend packaging no more than 2 cores in each jar to avoid reduction of the cancer detection rate through inadequate tissue sampling.'

aS"To increase the vaccination rate and identify barriers to administration of the vaccine against herpes zoster by having ophthalmologists screen and provide the vaccine.Prospective interventional cohort study.Academic City Hospital, Bellevue Hospital.A total of 100 eligible patients based on recommended Centers for Disease Control (CDC) criteria and ability to speak English and Spanish who received the herpes zoster vaccine were compared with 66 patients who declined the vaccine.The vaccine was administered after written informed consent was obtained to complete a screening questionnaire evaluating the participants' eligibility and interest in receiving the vaccine.Barriers to administration of the vaccine were evaluated.A total of 170 consenting patients, including 100 patients who were vaccinated, 66 patients who declined vaccination, and 4 patients who were ineligible, were analyzed. The proportion of subjects who would consider receiving the vaccine if recommended by a doctor among those who received the shingles vaccine, 98.0% (95% CI: 95%-100%), was significantly greater than the proportion in the group that declined, 74.2% (95% CI: 64%-85%) (P \xe2\x89\xa4 .0001). The most common reason that patients declined the vaccine was wanting to speak with their primary care physician, 46.9% (95% CI: 33%-61%).Ophthalmologists can screen, educate, and prescribe the vaccine against herpes zoster in order to increase utilization of this vaccine. Nonfinancial or access barriers of this vaccine among underserved eligible patients include absence of recommendation by their primary care doctor."

aS'Intracorporeal injections have low use rates and high discontinuation rates. We examined factors associated with intracorporeal injection use, long-term satisfaction with intracorporeal injection and reasons for discontinuation in men treated with radical prostatectomy.Between October 2000 and September 2003, 731 men who underwent open radical retropubic prostatectomy were enrolled in a prospective outcomes study. The 8-year followup evaluation included the UCLA-PCI, and a survey capturing intracorporeal injection use, satisfaction and reasons for discontinuation. Logistic regression was used to determine associations between intracorporeal injection use and preoperative variables.The 8-year self-assessment was completed by 368 (50.4%) men. Of these men 140 (38%) indicated prior or current intracorporeal injection use, with only 34 using intracorporeal injection at 8 years. Overall, 44% of the men were satisfied with intracorporeal injections. Reasons for discontinuation included dislike (47%), pain (33%), return of erection (19%), inefficacy (14%) and no partner (6%). Men trying intracorporeal injections had greater preoperative UCLA-PCI sexual function scores (75.2 vs 65.62, p = 0.00005) as well as greater decreases in this score at 3 months (p = 0.0002) and 2 years (p = 0.003). Higher preoperative sexual function scores were independently associated with the use of intracorporeal injections in a model adjusted for age, marital status, nerve sparing status and body mass index (OR 1.021, 95% CI 1.008-1.035).Men pursuing intracorporeal injections have better baseline erectile function and experience greater deterioration in erectile function during the early postoperative period. Despite the high efficacy of injections, many men discontinue intracorporeal injections due to dislike or discomfort. Satisfaction rates for intracorporeal injections indicate their long-term role in restoring sexual function in men with post-prostatectomy erectile dysfunction.'

aS"An integral part of NICHE (Nurses Improving Care for Healthsystem Elders) is a benchmarking service that provides member sites with the ability to evaluate staff perceptions of the care environment compared with other NICHE sites. The NICHE Database includes more than 100,000 surveys (Geriatric Institutional Assessment Profile). This study aimed to explain how secondary analyses of this aggregate database can inform effective geriatric programming in hospitals. We found that nurse age and experience influence nurse perceptions of organizational alignment to NICHE guiding principles and that those perceptions improve following NICHE implementation. The NICHE Database addresses knowledge generation in key areas of geriatric nursing practice and assists hospitals' systemic capacity to effectively embed NICHE Guiding Principles: evidence-based geriatric knowledge, patient-family centered care, healthy and productive practice environment, and multidimensional metrics of quality. It contributes to the growing field of implementation science that seeks to promote the uptake of research findings into clinical practice."

aS"Repetitive behaviors in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) range from motor stereotypy to immersion in restricted interests. The modified Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale for children with autism spectrum disorder (CYBOCS-ASD) includes a Symptom Checklist (behavior present or absent) and 5 severity scales (Time Spent, Interference, Distress, Resistance and Control).We assembled CYBOCS-ASD data from 3 Research Units on Pediatric Psychopharmacology Autism Network trials to explore the component structure of repetitive behaviors in children with ASD. Raters trained to reliability conducted the CYBOCS-ASD in 272 medication-free subjects. Fifteen Symptom Checklist items were endorsed for less than 5% of the sample and were dropped. Principal component analysis was used to explore the clustering of 23 checklist items. Component scores computed for each subject were correlated with other measures. We also examined the distribution of severity scales.The subjects (229 boys and 43 girls; mean age\xc2\xa0= 7.8 \xc2\xb1 2.6 years) met criteria for an ASD; half were intellectually disabled. The PCA resulted in a 5-component solution to classify repetitive behaviors (34.4% of the variance): hoarding and ritualistic behavior; sensory and arranging behavior; sameness and self-injurious behavior; stereotypy; restricted interests. Sensory and arranging and stereotypy components were associated with lower adaptive functioning (Pearson r\xc2\xa0= 0.2-0.3; p\xc2\xa0< .003). The resistance scale showed little variation, with more than 60% of the sample with the highest score.Rarely endorsed items can be dropped from the Checklist. The resistance item does not appear to be relevant for children with ASD."

aS'In the recent era, no congenital heart defect has undergone a more dramatic change in diagnostic approach, management, and outcomes than hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS). During this time, survival to the age of 5 years (including Fontan) has ranged from 50% to 69%, but current expectations are that 70% of newborns born today with HLHS may reach adulthood. Although the 3-stage treatment approach to HLHS is now well founded, there is significant variation among centers. In this white paper, we present the current state of the art in our understanding and treatment of HLHS during the stages of care: 1) pre-Stage I: fetal and neonatal assessment and management; 2) Stage I: perioperative care, interstage monitoring, and management strategies; 3) Stage II: surgeries; 4) Stage III: Fontan surgery; and 5) long-term follow-up. Issues surrounding the genetics of HLHS, developmental outcomes, and quality of life are addressed in addition to the many other considerations for caring for this group of complex patients.'

aS'The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the association of open and closed Fontan fenestration status with event-free survival.All patients who underwent a fenestrated Fontan procedure at our institution from January 1994 through June 2007 were reviewed. Patient information was obtained from the medical records. The patients were assigned to 1 of 2 study groups, open or closed, according to their most recent fenestration status. Clinically relevant morbid events were tabulated, and Kaplan-Meier event analysis was used to create event-free probability curves with log-rank comparisons.A total of 161 patients were classified as open and 51 as closed. The median interval to an event was 1.1 years (interquartile range, 0.1-3.3 years) after the Fontan procedure. The median interval to closure was 1.2 years (interquartile range, 0.7-3.3 years). The median interval to an event was 1.5 years (interquartile range, 0.1-4.6 years) in the closed group and 1.1 years (interquartile range, 0.1-3.3 years) in the open group. Event-free probability analysis revealed no significant difference between the 2 groups (P\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0.15). The median follow-up arterial oxygen saturation was greater in the closed group (96.0%; interquartile range, 94.0%-97.0%) than in the open group (91.0%; interquartile range, 86.0%-95.0%; P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa0.0001).Fenestration closure was associated with greater arterial oxygen saturation but not greater event-free survival. The interval to an event was slightly less than the interval to fenestration closure, suggesting potential merit in the evaluation of earlier fenestration closure. Adoption of specific fenestration management guidelines might help improve the overall outcomes and enhance the quality of future studies.'

aS'The purpose of this study was to examine the role of initial diabetes education delivery at an academic medical center (AMC) versus non-AMCs on long-term glycemic control.We performed a retrospective study of children with type 1 diabetes referred to an AMC after being educated at non-AMCs. These children were matched to a group of children diagnosed and educated as inpatients at an AMC. The A1C levels at 2, 3, and 5 years from diagnosis were compared between the 2 groups of children.Records were identified from 138 children. Glycemic control was comparable in the non-AMC-educated versus AMC-educated patients at 2, 3, and 5 years from diagnosis. The A1C was also highly consistent in each patient over time.Long-term glycemic control was independent of whether initial education was delivered at an AMC or non-AMC. Formal education and location at time of diagnosis do not appear to play a significant role in long-term glycemic control. Novel educational constructs, focusing on developmental stages of childhood and reeducation over time, are likely more important than education at time of diagnosis.'

aS'A handoff is the process of conveying necessary information in order to transfer primary responsibility for providing safe and effective drug therapy to a patient from one community pharmacist to another, typically during a shift change. The handoff information conveyed in pharmacies has been shown to be unstructured and variable, leading to pharmacist stress and frustration, prescription delays, and medication errors.The purpose of this study was to describe and categorize the information hazards present in handoffs in community pharmacies.A qualitative research approach was used to elicit the subjective experiences of community pharmacists. Community pharmacists who float or work in busy community pharmacies were recruited and participated in a face to face semi-structured interview. Using a systematic content data analysis, the study identified five categories of information hazards that can lead to information chaos, a framework grounded in human factors and ergonomics.Information hazards including erroneous information and information overload, underload, scatter, and conflict, are experienced routinely by community pharmacists during handoff communication and can result in information chaos. The consequences of information chaos include increased mental workload, which can precipitate problematic prescriptions "falling between the cracks." This can ultimately impact patient care and pharmacist quality of working life.The results suggest that handoffs in community pharmacies result in information hazards. These information hazards can distract pharmacists from their primary work of assessing prescriptions and educating their patients. Further research on how handoffs are conducted can produce information on how hazards in the system can be eliminated.'

aS"Surgeons may be reluctant to withdraw postoperative life support after a poor outcome.A cross-sectional random sample was taken from a US mail survey of 2100 surgeons who routinely perform high-risk operations. We used a hypothetical vignette of a specialty-specific operation complicated by a hemiplegic stroke and respiratory failure. On postoperative day 7, the patient and family requested withdrawal of life-supporting therapy. We experimentally modified the timing and role of surgeon error to assess their influence on surgeons' willingness to withdraw life-supporting care.The adjusted response rate was 56%. Sixty-three percent of respondents would not honor the request to withdraw life-supporting treatment. Willingness to withdraw life-support was significantly lower in the setting of surgeon error (33% vs 41%, P < 0.008) and elective operations rather than in emergency cases (33% vs 41%, P = 0.01). After adjustment for specialty, years of experience, geographic region, and gender, odds of withdrawing life-supporting therapy were significantly greater in cases in which the outcome was not explicitly from error during an emergency operation as compared to iatrogenic injury in elective cases (odds ratio 1.95, 95% confidence intervals 1.26-3.01). Surgeons who did not withdraw life-support were significantly more likely to report the importance of optimism regarding prognosis (79% vs 62%, P < 0.0001) and concern that the patient could not accurately predict future quality of life (80% vs 68%, P < 0.0001).Surgeons are more reluctant to withdraw postoperative life-supporting therapy for patients with complications from surgeon error in the elective setting. This may also be influenced by personal optimism and a belief that patients are unable to predict the value of future health states."

aS"To estimate the possible relationship between statin use and the risk of healthcare facility onset Clostridium difficile.Patients over 18 years of age admitted to hospitals contributing data to the University HealthSystem Consortium between 2002 and 2009 were eligible. Patients with the ICD-9-CM code 008.45 who received a minimum 3-day course of either metronidazole or oral vancomycin on/after day 5 of admission were considered incident cases of C difficile infection. 31,472 incident cases of C difficile infection were identified and matched to five controls, on hospital, year/quarter of admission date, and age \xc2\xb110 years (N=78,096). Patients who were administered one drug in the statin class (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin or simvastatin) before the index date were considered to be exposed. Conditional logistic regression modelling provided adjusted odds ratios and 95% CI.Compared with non-users, users of any drug within the statin class were 0.78 times less likely to develop C difficile infection in the hospital (95% CI 0.75 to 0.81) adjusting for potential confounders. Differences in estimates for specific statins were minimal. Niacin, fibrates and selective cholesterol absorption inhibitors showed no association with the risk of C difficile infection.Our data were consistent with a growing body of literature demonstrating a reduced risk of infections with statin use. Statins' pleiotropic properties may provide protection against C difficile infection."

aS'Emergency medicine research conducted under the exception from informed consent (EFIC) regulation enables critical scientific advancements. When EFIC is proposed, there is a requirement for broad community consultation and public disclosure (CC/PD) regarding the risks and benefits of the study. At the present time, no clear guidelines or standards exist for conducting and evaluating the CC/PD. This preliminary study tested the feasibility and acceptability of a new approach to CC/PD for a large-scale EFIC trial by engaging community members in designing and conducting the strategies. The authors enrolled key community members (called community advocates for research, or CARs) to use community-based participatory methods to design and implement CC/PD. By partnering with community members who represent target populations for the research study, this new approach has demonstrated a feasible CC/PD plan with greater community participation and less cost than previous studies. In a community survey, the percentage of community members reporting having heard about the EFIC trial more than doubled after employing the new approach. This article discusses initial implementation and results.'

aS"Methotrexate (MTX) is considered the 'anchor drug' in the therapy of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), yet many physicians do not optimise MTX regimens in spite of high RA disease activity. The recent development of an auto-injector for the subcutaneous (subQ) administration of MTX has prompted re-evaluation of MTX utilisation. The purpose of this systematic literature review is to determine the optimal dose, drug level, and route of administration for MTX in the context of relevant pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenomics.A systematic literature review was performed in Medline searching specifically for randomised controlled trials, systematic reviews, case control and cohort studies evaluating outcomes related to MTX dose and route of administration. Articles fulfilling these inclusion criteria were reviewed. Data on MTX dose, route of administration, clinical response, drug levels and adverse events were evaluated.Our search identified 420 articles of which 6 were eligible for inclusion using the above criteria. These included 2 systematic reviews, 2 randomised open label trials, one longitudinal study and one retrospective cohort study.Efficacy and toxicity for MTX appear related to absorbed dose of MTX, not to route of administration. While bioavailability is greater for parenteral MTX, there is no evidence yet that splitting the oral dose of MTX is less advantageous, less safe or less tolerable than administering parenteral MTX. However, there appear to be modest benefits in beginning with higher doses of MTX, and switching to parenteral MTX when the clinical response to an oral dose is inadequate."

aS"Coronary angiography is the gold standard for defining obstructive coronary disease. However, radiation exposure remains an unwanted hazard. Patients referred for coronary angiography with abdominal circumference<45 inches and glomerular filtration rate>60 ml/min were randomized to the fluorography (n=25) or cineangiography (n=25) group. Patients in the fluorography group underwent coronary angiography using retrospectively stored fluorography with repeat injection under cineangiography only when needed for better resolution per operator's discretion. Patients in the cineangiography group underwent coronary angiography using routine cineangiography. The primary end point was patient radiation exposure measured by radiochromic film. Secondary end points included the radiation output measurement of kerma-area product and air kerma at the interventional reference point (Ka,r) and operator radiation exposure measured by a dosimeter. Patient radiation exposure (158.2 mGy [76.5 to 210.2] vs 272.5 mGy [163.3 to 314.0], p=0.001), kerma-area product (1,323 \xce\xbcGy\xc2\xb7m2 [826 to 1,765] vs 3,451 \xce\xbcGy\xc2\xb7m2 [2,464 to 4,818], p<0.001), and Ka,r (175 mGy [112 to 252] vs 558 mGy [313 to 621], p<0.001) were significantly lower in the fluorography compared with cineangiography group (42%, 62%, and 69% relative reduction, respectively). Operator radiation exposure trended in the same direction, although statistically nonsignificant (fluorography 2.35 \xce\xbcGy [1.24 to 6.30] vs cineangiography 5.03 \xce\xbcGy [2.48 to 7.80], p=0.059). In conclusion, the use of fluorography in a select group of patients during coronary angiography, with repeat injection under cineangiography only when needed, was efficacious at reducing patient radiation exposure."

aS'Use of electronic health records (EHRs) in primary-care exam rooms changes the dynamics of patient-physician interaction. This study examines and compares doctor-patient non-verbal communication (eye-gaze patterns) during primary care encounters for three different screen/information sharing groups: (1) active information sharing, (2) passive information sharing, and (3) technology withdrawal.Researchers video recorded 100 primary-care visits and coded the direction and duration of doctor and patient gaze. Descriptive statistics compared the length of gaze patterns as a percentage of visit length. Lag sequential analysis determined whether physician eye-gaze influenced patient eye gaze, and vice versa, and examined variations across groups.Significant differences were found in duration of gaze across groups. Lag sequential analysis found significant associations between several gaze patterns. Some, such as DGP-PGD ("doctor gaze patient" followed by "patient gaze doctor") were significant for all groups. Others, such DGT-PGU ("doctor gaze technology" followed by "patient gaze unknown") were unique to one group.Some technology use styles (active information sharing) seem to create more patient engagement, while others (passive information sharing) lead to patient disengagement.Doctors can engage patients in communication by using EHRs in the visits. EHR training and design should facilitate this.'

As measured according to kappa scores and in all four situations and in the degree of latitude, intervention group surrogates demonstrated a significantly higher degree of understanding of patient goals than control group surrogates. Intervention group kappa scores ranged from 0.61 to 0.78, whereas control group kappa scores ranged from 0.07 to 0.28.Surrogates in the intervention group had a significantly better understanding of patient goals and preferences than surrogates in the control group. This finding is the first step toward ensuring that patient goals for care are known and honored.'

aS'To identify the processes, surgeons use to establish patient buy-in to postoperative treatments.Surgeons generally believe they confirm the patient\'s commitment to an operation and all ensuing postoperative care, before surgery. How surgeons get buy-in and whether patients participate in this agreement is unknown.We used purposive sampling to identify 3 surgeons from different subspecialties who routinely perform high-risk operations at each of 3 distinct medical centers (Toronto, Ontario; Boston, Massachusetts; Madison, Wisconsin). We recorded preoperative conversations with 3 to 7 patients facing high-risk surgery with each surgeon (n = 48) and used content analysis to analyze each preoperative conversation inductively.Surgeons conveyed the gravity of high-risk operations to patients by emphasizing the operation is "big surgery" and that a decision to proceed invoked a serious commitment for both the surgeon and the patient. Surgeons were frank about the potential for serious complications and the need for intensive care. They rarely discussed the use of prolonged life-supporting treatment, and patients\' questions were primarily confined to logistic or technical concerns. Surgeons regularly proceeded through the conversation in a manner that suggested they believed buy-in was achieved, but this agreement was rarely forged explicitly.Surgeons who perform high-risk operations communicate the risks of surgery and express their commitment to the patient\'s survival. However, they rarely discuss prolonged life-supporting treatments explicitly and patients do not discuss their preferences. It is not possible to determine patients\' desires for prolonged postoperative life support on the basis of these preoperative conversations alone.'

aS'Ovarian cancer (OC) is associated with a >75% risk of recurrence after completion of primary therapy. Several clinical trials have explored the role of continued therapy after complete response to primary adjuvant therapy to reduce the risk of recurrence; however, these trials have largely been underpowered, leading to inconclusive results.A systematic search strategy was initiated to identify all clinical trials involving consolidation or maintenance therapy regimens for OC in first complete remission. A meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate toxicity and progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS).There were 37 publications meeting all eligibility criteria, representing 20 consolidation and 9 maintenance therapy trials. Consolidation and maintenance therapies were associated with improved PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.79 [P = .003] and HR, 0.82 [P = .02], respectively) and OS (HR, 0.68 [P = .0008] and HR, 0.68 [P = .007], respectively). This relationship remained statistically significant when the analysis was limited to randomized trials and across other sensitivity analyses.Although individual studies have not yet convincingly shown a survival advantage with maintenance chemotherapy in OC, this meta-analysis demonstrates that continued chemotherapy after completion of primary therapy for OC improves PFS and OS. Benefits are greatest in patients with advanced stage OC who reach complete clinical or pathologic response after primary therapy.'

aS'Pediatric patients supported on ventricular assist devices (VADs) require systemic anticoagulation and are at risk for intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Little is known about the incidence or outcomes of pediatric patients with ICH while supported on a VAD. A retrospective chart review of all patients receiving VAD support was completed. Patients diagnosed with ICH while supported on a VAD were identified. Significant factors prior to diagnosis of ICH, medical/surgical treatment of ICH, and patient outcomes were assessed. Five of 30 (17%) patients supported on a VAD from January 2000 to November 2012 were diagnosed with an ICH. Four patients had an identified cerebral thromboembolic injury prior to the ICH. Four patients required interruption in their anticoagulation regimen due to other bleeding concerns prior to ICH. Neurosurgical intervention consisted of evacuation of hemorrhage in one, whereas two others required management of hydrocephalus with external ventricular drainage. Three of the five patients died on VAD support. Two deaths were directly related to ICH, whereas the third was unrelated. Two patients were successfully transplanted; one remains with a significant neurological impairment, and the other has recovered with minimal residual impairment following neurosurgical evacuation of a large subdural hematoma. ICH is a devastating complication of VAD support. Prior ischemic infarcts and interruptions to anticoagulation may put a patient at risk for ICH. Prompt neurosurgical evaluation/intervention can result in positive outcomes.'

aS"The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study and its ancillary Memory Study (WHIMS) revealed increased rates of cardiovascular risk, cognitive decline and dementia with opposed conjugated equine estrogens (CEE). As a result, previously accepted observational data suggesting cardiovascular and cognitive benefits and reduced risk for dementia with hormone therapy (HT) were largely attributed to 'healthy-user' bias. The present observational, community-based, case-controlled study examined the 'healthy-user' bias theory by comparing cognitive task performance in two groups of postmenopausal women, who were either HT users or non-users.Participants were 213 non-demented, postmenopausal women residing in the community and in assisted-living facilities who completed a self-report health questionnaire and underwent a 1-h cognitive test battery. To study the independent contribution of variables in the prediction of cognitive performance, we employed a series of hierarchical regression models adding terms in three stages. The first stage included only HT, the second stage added demographics, and the last stage added alcohol, depression and a cardiovascular risk factor (CVRF) composite derived from a confirmatory factor analysis. The CVRF composite consisted of: stroke, diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia.Although independent samples t-tests revealed no statistically significant differences in the CVRF composite and its individual components between the two groups, HT users tended to possess fewer CVRF than non-users. Conversely, HT users were younger and more educated than non-users. HT users outperformed non-users on 7/9 cognitive variables. The full regression model controlling for CVRF, demographic variables, and mood showed HT users outperformed non-users on measures of verbal memory and abstract reasoning.While there is some evidence HT users possess fewer preexisting CVRF than non-users, the observed positive association between HT and cognition is not completely explained by this trend."

aS"Third-year internal medicine residents participating in a quality improvement rotation identified gaps between the Joint Commission's ORYX quality guidelines and clinical practices for the inpatient management of heart failure (HF) at the William S. Middleton Memorial Veterans Hospital. Residents focused on the performance metrics associated with tobacco-cessation counselling documentation, ejection fraction assessment and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker prescriptions.After analysing data collected by the External Peer Review Program, residents reviewed the institution's admissions and discharge processes with the aim of improving quality and compliance. In redesigning these processes, residents created an admissions template and a discharge face sheet, and compared specific ORYX measure compliance rates before and after institution-wide implementation.Following implementation of the tobacco-cessation admissions template, 100% of HF patients who used tobacco received documented cessation counselling, compared with 59% prior to intervention (p<0.01, n=32). Following implementation of the mandatory discharge face sheet, 97% of HF patients (compared with 92% preintervention, p>0.05) received comprehensive discharge instruction; LV function assessment went from 98% to 100% (p>0.05); and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker prescription for left ventricular systolic dysfunction at discharge (or documentation of a contra-indication) went from 82% to 100% (p<0.01, n=48).By implementing a standardised admissions template and a mandatory discharge face sheet, the hospital improved its processes of documentation and increased adherence to quality-performance measures. By strengthening residents' learning and commitment to quality improvement, the hospital created a foundation for future changes in the systems that affect patient care."

aS'Despite the wide implementation of dysphagia therapies, it is unclear whether these therapies are successfully communicated beyond the inpatient setting. The aim of this study was to examine the rate of dysphagia recommendation omissions in hospital discharge summaries for high-risk subacute care (i.e., skilled nursing facility, rehabilitation, long-term care) populations. We performed a retrospective cohort study that included all stroke and hip fracture patients billed for inpatient dysphagia evaluations by speech-language pathologists (SLPs) and discharged to subacute care from 2003 through 2005 from a single large academic medical center (N=187). Dysphagia recommendations from final SLP hospital notes and from hospital (physician) discharge summaries were abstracted, coded, and compared for each patient. Recommendation categories included dietary (food and liquid), postural/compensatory techniques (e.g., chin tuck), rehabilitation (e.g., exercise), meal pacing (e.g., small bites), medication delivery (e.g., crush pills), and provider/supervision (e.g., 1-to-1 assist). Forty-five percent of discharge summaries omitted all SLP dysphagia recommendations. Forty-seven percent (88/186) of patients with SLP dietary recommendations, 82% (93/114) with postural, 100% (16/16) with rehabilitation, 90% (69/77) with meal pacing, 95% (21/22) with medication, and 79% (96/122) with provider/supervision recommendations had these recommendations completely omitted from their discharge summaries. Discharge summaries omitted all categories of SLP recommendations at notably high rates. Improved post-hospital communication strategies are needed for discharges to subacute care.'

aS'We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy using 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin (5FU/LV), and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) compared with 5FU/LV alone and 5FU/LV compared with observation alone for patients who had resected stage II colon cancer.We developed 2 Markov models to represent the adjuvant chemotherapy and follow-up periods and a single Markov model to represent the observation group. We used calibration to estimate the transition probabilities among different toxicity levels. The base case considered 60-year-old patients who had undergone an uncomplicated hemicolectomy for stage II colon cancer and were medically fit to receive 6 months of adjuvant chemotherapy. We measured health outcomes in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and estimated costs using 2007 US dollars.In the base case, adjuvant chemotherapy of the FOLFOX regimen had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $54,359/QALY compared with the 5FU/LV regimen, and the 5FU/LV regimen had an ICER of $14,584/QALY compared with the observation group from the third-party payer perspective. The ICER values were most sensitive to 5-year relapse probability, cost of adjuvant chemotherapy, and the discount rate for the FOLFOX arm, whereas the ICER value of 5FU/LV was most sensitive to the 5-year relapse probability, 5-year survival probability, and the relapse cost. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicates that the ICER of 5FU/LV is less than $50,000/QALY with a probability of 99.62%, and the ICER of FOLFOX as compared with 5FU/LV is less than $50,000/QALY and $100,000/QALY with a probability of 44.48% and 97.24%, respectively.Although adjuvant chemotherapy with 5FU/LV is cost-effective at all ages for patients who have undergone an uncomplicated hemicolectomy for stage II colon cancer, FOLFOX is not likely to be cost-effective as compared with 5FU/LV.'

aS'American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z0011 demonstrated that eligible breast cancer patients with positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) could be spared an axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) without sacrificing survival or local control. Although heralded as a \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98practice-changing trial,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 some argue that the stringent inclusion criteria limit the trial\xe2\x80\x99s clinical significance. The objective was to assess the potential impact of ACOSOG Z0011 on axillary surgical management of Medicare patients and examine current practice patterns.Medicare beneficiaries aged C66 years with nonmetastatic invasive breast cancer diagnosed from 2001 to 2007 were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare database (n = 59,431). Eligibility for ACOSOG Z0011 was determined: SLN mapping, tumor\\5 cm, no neoadjuvant treatment, breast conservation; number of positive nodes was determined. Actual surgical axillary management for eligible patients was assessed.Twelve percent (6,942/59,431) underwent SLN mapping and were node positive. Overall, 2,637 patients (4.4 % (2,637/59,431) of the total cohort, but 38 % (2,637/6,942) of patients with SLN mapping and positive nodes) met inclusion criteria for ACOSOG Z0011, had 1 or 2 positive lymph nodes, and could have been spared an ALND. Of these 2,637 patients, 46 % received a completion ALND and 54 % received only SLN biopsy.Widespread implementation of ACOSOG Z0011 trial results could potentially spare 38 % of older breast cancer patients who undergo SLN mapping with positive lymph nodes an ALND. However, 54 % of these patients are already managed with SLN biopsy alone, lessening the impact of this trial on clinical practice in older breast cancer patients.'

aS"We examined whether a sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic could reach women who had not received a Papanicolau (Pap) test in the past 3 years. We also explored staff attitudes and implementation of cervical cancer screening.Women (n = 123) aged 30 to 50 years were offered cervical cancer screening in an Indiana STD clinic. We measured effectiveness by the patients' self-reported last Pap test. We explored adoption of screening through focus groups with 34 staff members by documenting their attitudes about cervical cancer screening and screening strategy adaptation. We also documented recruitment and screening implementation.Almost half (47.9%) of participants reported a last Pap test 3 or more years previously; 30% had reported a last Pap more than 5 years ago, and 11.4% had a high-risk test outcome that required referral to colposcopy. Staff supported screening because of mission alignment and perceived patient benefit. Screening adaptations included eligibility, results provision, and follow-up.Cervical cancer screening was possible and potentially beneficial in STD clinics. Future effectiveness-implementation studies should expand to include all female patients, and should examine the degree to which adaptation of selected adoption frameworks is feasible."

aS'Outpatient pain management after acute injuries is an important part of emergency department (ED) care, but there is little evidence to support best practice. Satisfaction with care is one way to assess the effectiveness of current practice. This study describes the outpatient pain experience for children with an arm fracture and explores the variables associated with parents\' dissatisfaction with pain treatment for 2 analgesics after ED care.As a part of a randomized clinical trial assessing pain treatment after an arm fracture, parents and their children completed daily diaries recording pain scores, function disruption (play, school, sleep, eating), and adverse effects for 3 days after discharge from the ED. Parents and children also completed the Total Quality Pain Management Instrument on the third day to assess pain experience. Parents\' satisfaction was defined with an arm fracture lowest reported satisfaction during the study period.A total of 244 children with complete diaries were analyzed. More than half of children reported pain at home that was present "all the time" or "quite a bit." Thirty-two percent of parents were not satisfied with home pain treatment for their child. Parents\' dissatisfaction was strongly associated with inadequate pain relief. It was also independently associated with nausea, disruption in play and sleep, and increased doses of medication.Children with arm fractures experience noteworthy pain in the outpatient setting. Parents\' dissatisfaction with home pain management for children suggests that more research is needed to evaluate the factors that result in improvements in both parent and child satisfaction and the most effective way of producing those changes.'

aS'Techniques for achieving hemispheric disconnection in patients with epilepsy continue to evolve.To review the outcomes of the first 50 hemispherectomy surgeries performed by a single surgeon with an emphasis on outcomes, complications, and how these results led to changes in practice.The first 50 hemispherectomy cases performed by the lead author were identified from a prospectively maintained database. Patient demographics, surgical details, clinical outcomes, and complications were critically reviewed.From 2004 to 2012, 50 patients underwent hemispherectomy surgery (mean follow-up time, 3.5 years). Modified lateral hemispherotomy became the preferred technique and was performed on 44 patients. Forty patients (80%) achieved complete seizure freedom (Engel I). Presurgical and postsurgical neuropsychological evaluations demonstrated cognitive stability. Two cases were performed for palliation only. Previous hemispherectomy surgery was associated with worsened seizure outcome (2 of 6 seizure free; P .005). The use of Avitene was associated with a higher incidence of postoperative hydrocephalus (56% vs 18%; P = .03). In modified lateral hemispherotomy patients without the use of Avitene, the incidence of hydrocephalus was 13%. Complications included infection (n = 3), incomplete disconnection requiring reoperation (n = 1), reversible ischemic neurological deficit (n = 1), and craniosynostosis (n = 1). There were no (unanticipated) permanent neurological deficits or deaths. Minor technique modifications were made in response to specific complications.The modified lateral hemispherotomy is effective and safe for both initial and revision hemispherectomy surgery. Avitene use appears to result in a greater incidence of postoperative hydrocephalus.'

aS"The array of therapeutic options available to clinicians for treating retinal disease is expanding. With these advances comes the need for better understanding of the etiology of these diseases on a cellular level as well as improved non-invasive tools for identifying the best candidates for given therapies and monitoring the efficacy of those therapies. While spectral domain optical coherence tomography offers a widely available tool for clinicians to assay the living retina, it suffers from poor lateral resolution due to the eye's monochromatic aberrations. Ophthalmic adaptive optics (AO) is a technique to compensate for the eye's aberrations and provide nearly diffraction-limited resolution. The result is the ability to visualize the living retina with cellular resolution. While AO is unquestionably a powerful research tool, many clinicians remain undecided on the clinical potential of AO imaging - putting many at a crossroads with respect to adoption of this technology. This review will briefly summarize the current state of AO retinal imaging, discuss current as well as future clinical applications of AO retinal imaging, and finally provide some discussion of research needs to facilitate more widespread clinical use."

aS"This study prospectively compared the effect of secondary prophylaxis to episodic treatment on target joint (TJ) range of motion (ROM), number of joint haemorrhages and new TJ development in patients with moderate or severe haemophilia. Two-hundred and eighty-six males, 17% in prophylaxis, 83% in episodic treatment group, participating in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Universal Data Collection project, fulfilled inclusion criteria: age >2 years at enrollment, free of TJs at enrollment, developed at least one TJ after enrollment, and received either prophylaxis or episodic treatment continuously for two follow-up visits after TJ development. The outcomes of interest - percentage change in TJ ROM, number of joint haemorrhages and new TJ development, were modelled using multivariate linear, Poisson and logistic regression techniques respectively. Individuals who received secondary prophylaxis in comparison to episodic treatment were younger at TJ development (P < 0.01); there was no difference in the decrease in TJ ROM between the two groups (P = 0.9). Factors significantly associated with a higher rate of haemarthroses included episodic treatment, severe haemophilia, age >5 years at TJ development, obesity and inhibitor negative status. Secondary prophylaxis significantly decreased haemarthroses but was not associated with a significant improvement in TJ ROM or with new TJ development."

aS'Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a serious complication of liver disease and portosystemic shunting that represents a continuum of neuropsychiatric changes and altered consciousness. It is classified as overt HE (OHE) when clinically apparent or as covert HE (CHE) in its mildest form. Progression of CHE to OHE and its impact of quality of life make its early diagnosis imperative. Several diagnostic techniques ranging from simple clinical scales to sophisticated computerized tests exist, yet diagnosis remains a challenge, due to the time, cost, and personnel involved. Psychometric tests appear promising due to their high sensitivity and low cost, but results are variable depending on age and education. The pros and cons of current diagnostic methods for OHE and CHE are reviewed, along with strategy for CHE testing.'

CMTM, as delivered, consisted of (1) medication assessment, (2) development of care plan, and (3) follow-up.CMTM is integrated with the medical and mental health clinics of PCMH in a safety net setting that serves homeless individuals.Number of patients having a CMTM encounter, number and type of medication-related problems identified for a subset of patients in the mental health and medical clinics, pharmacist recommendations, and acceptance rate of pharmacist recommendations.Since October 2008, 695 patients have had a CMTM encounter. An analysis of 209 patients in the mental health clinic indicated that 425 medication-related problems were identified (2.0/patient). Pharmacists made 452 recommendations to resolve problems, and 384 (85%) pharmacist recommendations were accepted by providers and/or patients. For 40 patients in the medical clinic, 205 medication-related problems were identified (5.1/patient). Pharmacists made 217 recommendations to resolve the problems, and 194 (89%) recommendations were accepted.Integrating CMTM with a safety net PCMH was a valuable patient-centered strategy for addressing medication-related problems among homeless individuals. The high acceptance rate of pharmacist recommendations demonstrates the successful integration of pharmacist services.'

aS'Accurate assessment of dietary intake is essential for researchers and public health practitioners to make advancements in public health. This is especially important in Native Americans who display disease prevalence rates that are dramatically higher than the general US population.To evaluate three dietary assessment tools: dietary records, a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), and a shellfish assessment survey among Native American adults from the Communities Advancing the Studies of Tribal Nations Across the Lifespan (CoASTAL) cohort.The CoASTAL cohort was composed of randomly selected individuals from three tribal registries of Pacific Northwest Tribal Nations. This cross-sectional study used data from the baseline of CoASTAL and was restricted to the non-pregnant adults (aged 18 years or older) who completed the shellfish assessment survey (n=500), an FFQ (n=518), dietary records (n=444), weight measures (n=493), and height measures (n=496). Paired t tests, Pearson correlation coefficients, and percent agreement were used to evaluate the dietary records and the FFQ with and without accounting for plausibility of reported energy intake (rEI). Sensitivity and specificity as well as Spearman correlation coefficients were used to evaluate the shellfish assessment survey and the FFQ compared to dietary records.Statistically significant correlations between the FFQ and dietary records for selected nutrients were not the same by sex. Accounting for plausibility of rEI for the dietary records and the FFQ improved the strength of the correlations for percent energy from protein, energy from carbohydrate, and calcium for both men and women. In addition, the association between rEI (dietary records and FFQ) and weight became significant when the sample was limited to plausible rEI. The shellfish assessment survey was found to similarly assess shellfish consumption in comparison to the FFQ.These results support the benefit of multiple measures of diet, including regional and culturally specific surveys, especially among Native Americans. Accounting for plausibility of rEI may ensure more accurate estimations of dietary intakes.'

aS'Pharmacist attitudes about the over-the-counter (OTC) sale of HIV rapid tests in pharmacies were explored through interviews conducted among 17 licensed community pharmacists in a Midwestern, moderate HIV incidence state between May and September 2012. Participants recognized that OTC rapid HIV tests would increase the number of people aware of their HIV status. Concerns included linkage to care and results consultation for those who test HIV-positive. Point of sale was identified as an opportunity for consultation about the test and to establish a relationship for future discussion about results and linkage to care. Pharmacists could provide initial test consultation or information, and consultation about the test results in order to provide post diagnosis support and facilitate linkage to care.'

aS'The rates of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease in Native Americans and Alaska Natives far exceed that of the general US population. There are many postulating reasons for these excessive rates including the transition from a traditional to a contemporary diet. Although information on the dietary intakes of Native American and Alaska Native communities are limited, there seems to be a consensus that the Native American and Alaska Native diet is high in total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium. Further information on the diet needs to be attained so that dietary interventions can effectively be implemented in these communities. An approach that is community based is proposed as the best solution to understanding the Native diet and developing culturally tailored interventions to sustainably improve diet.'

aS'Injury is the leading cause of childhood morbidity and mortality in the US. The associated costs exceed $20 billion annually. This study examined disparities in disadvantaged populations of critically injured pediatric patients admitted to a level 1 pediatric trauma center.A retrospective study was conducted of all trauma patients admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) at a level 1 pediatric trauma hospital from 2005 to 2009.Data on 324 patients were analyzed; 45% of patients were Caucasian, 33% were African American, 12% were Hispanic, and 10% were other. There was no difference in age, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), or Injury Severity Score (ISS) across ethnic groups. The mortality rate was 12%. A higher percentage of Caucasians were commercially insured and from the highest income quartile than non-Caucasians (p < 0.001). African Americans had the highest rate of penetrating trauma and intentional injury compared with other ethnicities (p < 0.001). Nearly 75% of firearm injuries were clustered in 7 ZIP codes with the lowest median household incomes. The home was the most common location for firearm injuries. Children involved in assaults were more likely to have a single parent (67%) than 2 parents (26%, p < 0.001). Both ethnicity and payer status were significantly associated with mortality.Significant disparities in socioeconomic status exist in severely injured pediatric patients treated in the PICU. Disparities were associated with adverse outcomes. These results should inform community and public health efforts to identify the areas and populations at highest risk for violence-related injuries.'

aS"Medicare Part D was expected to have differential impacts on patient drug expenditures and use based on beneficiaries' levels of pre-Part D patient drug spending, but it is unknown whether these projections have borne out.We sought to evaluate whether and how the policy effect of Medicare Part D on drug expenditures and use was modified by levels of pre-Part D drug spending.A quasi-experimental, pretest-posttest, nonequivalent control group design was used. Data were obtained from a regional supermarket chain for all prescriptions dispensed between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2007 (n=1,230,612) to patients aged 60 years and older as of January 1, 2005 (n=51,305) to construct 12-month pre-Part D and post-Part D periods. Annual medication use was measured as the total number of pill days acquired. Annual drug expenditures were measured as total expenditures, patient out-of-pocket expenditures, and the proportion of total expenditures paid out of pocket by the patient.Part D resulted in significant reductions in out-of-pocket spending (17.6%) and significant increases in drug use (4.0%) for individuals in the highest pre-Part D drug-spending group relative to controls. The reduction in out-of-pocket spending for the highest pre-part D spending group was significantly greater compared with the moderate and lowest pre-Part D spending groups.Our findings suggest that, as expected, Part D facilitated access to medications for patients who previously experienced the greatest costs without adversely increasing use and costs among those with the lowest prior cost."

aS"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that places substantial burdens on those who provide support for family members with declining cognitive and functional abilities. Many AD patients eventually require formal long-term care services because of the absence, exhaustion, or inability of family members to provide care. The costs of long-term care, and especially nursing home care, often deplete private financial resources, placing a substantial burden on state Medicaid programs. Current evidence suggests that pharmacological treatments and caregiver interventions can delay entry into nursing homes and potentially reduce Medicaid costs. However, these cost savings are not being realized because many patients with AD are either not diagnosed or diagnosed at late stages of the disease, and have no access to Medicare-funded caregiver support programs.A Monte Carlo cost-benefit analysis, based on estimates of parameters available in the medical literature, suggests that the early identification and treatment of AD have the potential to result in large, positive net social benefits as well as positive net savings for states and the federal government.These findings indicate that the early diagnosis and treatment of AD are not only socially desirable in terms of increasing economic efficiency, but also fiscally attractive from both state and federal perspectives. These findings also suggest that failure to fund effective caregiver interventions may be fiscally unsound."

aS'Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is highly sensitive for detecting breast cancer. Low specificity, cost, and little evidence regarding mortality benefits, however, limit recommendations for its use to high-risk women. How breast MRI is actually used in community settings is unknown.To describe breast MRI trends and indications in a community setting.Retrospective cohort study at a not-for-profit health plan and multispecialty group medical practice in New England of 10,518 women aged 20 years and older enrolled in the health plan for at least 1 year who had at least 1 breast MRI between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2011.Breast MRI counts were obtained from claims data. Clinical indication (screening, diagnostic evaluation, staging or treatment, or surveillance) was determined using a prediction model developed from electronic medical records on a subset of participants. Breast cancer risk status was assessed using claims data and, for the subset, also through electronic medical record review. RESULTS; Breast MRI use increased more than 20-fold from 6.5 per 10,000 women in 2000 to 130.7 per 10,000 in 2009. Use then declined and stabilized to 104.8 per 10,000 by 2011. Screening and surveillance, rare indications in 2000, together accounted for 57.6% of MRI use by 2011; 30.1% had a claims-documented personal history and 51.7% a family history of breast cancer, whereas 3.5% of women had a documented genetic mutation. In the subset of women with electronic medical records who received screening or surveillance MRIs, only 21.0% had evidence of meeting American Cancer Society (ACS) criteria for breast MRI. Conversely, only 48.4% of women with documented deleterious genetic mutations received breast MRI screening.Breast MRI use increased steeply over 10 years and then stabilized, especially for screening and surveillance among women with family or personal history of breast cancer; most women receiving screening and surveillance breast MRIs lacked documented evidence of meeting ACS criteria, and many women with mutations were not screened. Efforts are needed to ensure that breast MRI use and documentation are focused on those women who will benefit most.'

aS'Despite the increasing enrollment of adult disabled beneficiaries into Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs), there is little evidence of its (hoped for) effectiveness at reducing Medicaid expenditures.: To evaluate the impact of Medicaid MCOs on health care expenditures for adults with disabilities.I employ a repeated observations design comparing individual monthly Medicaid expenditures across beneficiaries who reside in counties with mandatory, voluntary, and no MCOs. County-level Medicaid MCO program status for adults with disabilities was merged with the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and the Area Resource File for 1996-2004. Two-part regression models are used to estimate the probability and level of Medicaid expenditure.Working age Medicaid beneficiaries who receive Supplement Security Income for disability comprise the sample of 1613 individuals.Outcome measures include total and service-specific Medicaid expenditures.On average, total monthly Medicaid expenditures per beneficiary do not differ between FFS and MCO counties although some service-specific spending differs. Relative to FFS counties, average monthly Medicaid spending per beneficiary is higher for prescription medications in voluntary ($24) and mandatory ($25) MCO counties. Average Medicaid monthly spending for other medical care and dental care is $4 to $11 higher per beneficiary in MCO relative to FFS counties.Medicaid MCO programs as implemented are not associated with lower Medicaid spending; thus, state Medicaid programs should consider additional policy tools to contain health care expenditures in this population.'

To increase the usage of the HZ vaccine by studying physicians' knowledge, attitudes, practices, and perceived obstacles after interventions to overcome barriers.General internal medicine physicians were surveyed with a cross-sectional internet survey from October to December 2011 before interventions to increase the use of the HZ vaccine and 1 year later. Interventions included education, increasing availability at the medical center pharmacy, and electronic medical record reminders. Outcome measures included changes in knowledge, attitudes, and practices, and perceived barriers. McNemar chi-square tests were used to compare the changes from the baseline survey for physicians who completed the follow-up survey.Response rate for the baseline study was 33.5% (89/266) and for the follow-up was 29.8% (75/252). Fifty-five completed both surveys. There was a decrease from 57% at baseline to 40% at follow-up in the proportion of physicians who reported that less than 10% of their patients were vaccinated. They were more likely to know the HZ annual incidence (30% baseline; 70% follow-up; P=0.02), and report having educational information for physicians (7% baseline; 27% follow-up; P=0.003). The top helpful intervention was nursing administration of the vaccine. Average monthly HZ vaccine usage in the affiliated outpatient pharmacy increased in 10 months between surveys by 156% compared with the 3 months before the baseline survey.Interventions implemented during the study led to an increase in physicians' basic knowledge of the HZ vaccine and an increase in usage at the affiliated pharmacy."

aS'Identifying modifiable factors that influence the epidemiology of colorectal cancer incidence among multiethnic groups might be informative for the development of public health strategies targeting the disease. Minimal data exists describing the impact of physical activity on colorectal polyp risk in United States minority populations. The aim of this study is to evaluate the relationship of exercise on the prevalence of polyps in a multiethnic colorectal cancer screening population.We enrolled 982 patients: 558 Hispanic, 202 Asian,149 Black, and 69 White. Patients who reported exercising one or more hours weekly had a lower prevalence of any polyps (25.3% vs 33.2%, P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.008) as well as adenomas (13.8 vs. 18.9%, P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.03) compared to those who did not exercise. Black and Hispanic patients and those who were overweight or obese also had lower prevalence of polyps if they led an active lifestyle. Multivariate analysis revealed that age >55, male sex, and Black race/ethnicity were positively associated with the presence of adenomas, while a history of exercising one hour or more weekly was an independent negative predictor for the presence of adenomas anywhere in the colon (OR 0.67; 95% CI 0.4 - 0.9, P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.03).Exercising one hour per week was associated with a lower prevalence of polyps and adenomas when compared to those who exercised less or not at all. An active lifestyle provides benefits to groups who are at risk for colorectal cancer, such as Blacks. It also provides significant protection to overweight and obese individuals. Public health initiatives should promote physical activity as a cancer prevention tool in multiethnic populations.none.'

aS'Asian Americans experience diabetes at a higher rate than non-Hispanic whites. Diabetes prevention programs using lifestyle interventions have been shown to produce beneficial results, yet there have been no culturally-tailored programs for diabetes prevention in the Korean community. We explore the impact and feasibility of a pilot Community Health Worker (CHW) intervention to improve health behaviors and promote diabetes prevention among Korean Americans using a randomized controlled trial. Between 2011 and 2012, a total of 48 Korean Americans at risk for diabetes living in New York City (NYC) participated in the intervention. Participants were allocated to treatment or control groups. A community-based participatory research approach guided development of the intervention, which consisted of 6 workshops held by CHWs on diabetes prevention, nutrition, physical activity, diabetes complications, stress and family support, and access to health care. Changes over 6 months were examined for clinical measurements (weight, BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure, glucose, and cholesterol); health behaviors (physical activity, nutrition, food behaviors, diabetes knowledge, self-efficacy, and mental health); and health access (insurance and self-reported health). In this small pilot study, changes were seen in weight, waist circumference, diastolic blood pressure, physical activity nutrition, diabetes knowledge, and mental health. Qualitative findings provide additional contextual information that inform ways in which CHWs may influence health outcomes. These findings demonstrate that a diabetes prevention program can be successful among a Korean American population in NYC, and important insight is provided for ways that programs can be tailored to meet the needs of vulnerable populations.'

aS'The prevalence of lower urinary tract symptoms increases with age and impairs quality of life. Radical prostatectomy has been shown to relieve lower urinary tract symptoms at short-term followup but the long-term effect of radical prostatectomy on lower urinary tract symptoms is unclear.We performed a prospective cohort study of 1,788 men undergoing radical prostatectomy. The progression of scores from the self-administered AUASS (American Urological Association symptom score) preoperatively, and at 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 60, 84, 96 and 120 months was analyzed using models controlling for preoperative AUASS, age, prostate specific antigen, pathological Gleason score and stage, nerve sparing, race and marital status. This model was also applied to patients stratified by baseline clinically significant (AUASS greater than 7) and insignificant (AUASS 7 or less) lower urinary tract symptoms.Men exhibited an immediate worsening of lower urinary tract symptoms that improved between 3 months and 2 years after radical prostatectomy. Overall the difference between mean AUASS at baseline and at 10 years was not statistically or clinically significant. Men with baseline clinically significant lower urinary tract symptoms experienced immediate improvements in lower urinary tract symptoms that lasted until 10 years after radical prostatectomy (13.5 vs 8.81, p <0.001). Men with baseline clinically insignificant lower urinary tract symptoms experienced a statistically significant but clinically insignificant increase in mean AUASS after 10 years (3.09 to 4.94, p <0.001). The percentage of men with clinically significant lower urinary tract symptoms decreased from baseline to 10 years after radical prostatectomy (p = 0.02).Radical prostatectomy is the only treatment for prostate cancer shown to improve and prevent the development of lower urinary tract symptoms at long-term followup. This previously unrecognized long-term benefit argues in favor of the prostate as the primary contributor to male lower urinary tract symptoms.'

aS"To determine whether smaller brain volumes in older women who had completed Women's Health Initiative (WHI)-assigned conjugated equine estrogen-based hormone therapy (HT), reported by WHI Memory Study (WHIMS)-MRI, correspond to a continuing increased rate of atrophy an average of 6.1 to 7.7 years later in WHIMS-MRI2.A total of 1,230 WHI participants were contacted: 797 (64.8%) consented, and 729 (59%) were rescanned an average of 4.7 years after the initial MRI scan. Mean annual rates of change in total brain volume, the primary outcome, and rates of change in ischemic lesion volumes, the secondary outcome, were compared between treatment groups using mixed-effect models with adjustment for trial, clinical site, age, intracranial volumes, and time between MRI measures.Total brain volume decreased an average of 3.22 cm(3)/y in the active arm and 3.07 cm(3)/y in the placebo arm (p = 0.53). Total ischemic lesion volumes increased in both arms at a rate of 0.12 cm(3)/y (p = 0.88).Conjugated equine estrogen-based postmenopausal HT, previously assigned at WHI baseline, did not affect rates of decline in brain volumes or increases in brain lesion volumes during the 4.7 years between the initial and follow-up WHIMS-MRI studies. Smaller frontal lobe volumes were observed as persistent group differences among women assigned to active HT compared with placebo. Women with a history of cardiovascular disease treated with active HT, compared with placebo, had higher rates of accumulation in white matter lesion volume and total brain lesion volume. Further study may elucidate mechanisms that explain these findings."

aS'Many physicians are adopting patient portals in response to governmental incentives for meaningful use (MU), but the stage 2 requirements for portal use may be particularly challenging for newer electronic health record (EHR) users. This study examined enrollment, use based on MU requirements, and satisfaction in a recently adopting fee-for-service multispecialty system. Between 2010 and 2012, overall portal enrollment increased from 13.2% to 23.1% but varied substantially by physician specialty. In 2013, more than 97% of physicians would have met requirements for a stage 2 MU utilization measure requiring that patients download personal health information, but only 38% of all physicians (87% of primary care physicians [PCPs] and 37% of other specialists) would have met e-mail requirements. Satisfaction with the portal overall and with portal-based e-mails was high. These results suggest that later-adopting PCPs can succeed in providing satisfactory record and e-mail access but specialists may find reaching e-mail thresholds more difficult.'

aS"Most smoking cessation studies have used long-term abstinence as their primary outcome measure. Recent research has suggested that long-term abstinence may be an insensitive index of important smoking cessation mechanisms. The goal of the current study was to examine the effects of 5 smoking cessation pharmacotherapies using Shiffman et al.'s (2006) approach of examining the effect of smoking cessation medications on 3 process markers of cessation or smoking cessation milestones: initial abstinence, lapse, and the lapse-relapse transition.The current study (N = 1,504; 58.2% female and 41.8% male; 83.9% Caucasian, 13.6% African American, 2.5% other races) examined the effect of 5 smoking cessation pharmacotherapy treatments versus placebo (bupropion, nicotine lozenge, nicotine patch, bupropion + lozenge, patch + lozenge) on Shiffman et al.'s smoking cessation milestones over 8 weeks following a quit attempt.Results show that all 5 medication conditions decreased rates of failure to achieve initial abstinence and most (with the exception of the nicotine lozenge) decreased lapse risk; however, only the nicotine patch and bupropion + lozenge conditions affected the lapse-relapse transition.These findings demonstrate that medications are effective at aiding initial abstinence and decreasing lapse risk but that they generally do not decrease relapse risk following a lapse. The analysis of cessation milestones sheds light on important impediments to long-term smoking abstinence, suggests potential mechanisms of action of smoking cessation pharmacotherapies, and identifies targets for future treatment development."

Newly admitted residents in the intervention homes experienced a lower rate of potential delirium onset than those in usual care homes (adjusted hazard ratio (HR)=0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.35-0.52), overall hospitalization (adjusted HR=0.89, 95% CI=0.72-1.09), and mortality (adjusted HR=0.88, 95% CI=0.66-1.16). In longer stay residents, the effects of the intervention were attenuated, and all estimates included unity.Using health information technology in long-term care pharmacies to identify residents who might benefit from the implementation of prospective medication monitoring care plans when complex medication regimens carry potential risks for falls and delirium may reduce adverse effects associated with appropriate medication use.'

aS"Volunteer peer leaders (PLs) benefit from their involvement in health interventions but we know little about how they compare with other non-PL volunteers or with the intervention recipients themselves. We randomized 58 veterans' service organizations' posts (e.g. VFW) to peer- versus professionally led self-management support interventions. Our primary research questions were whether hypertensive PLs changed over the course of the project, whether they changed more than hypertensive volunteers who were not randomized to such a role [i.e. post representatives (PRs)] and whether they changed more than the intervention recipients with respect to health knowledge, health beliefs and health outcomes from baseline to 12 months. After the intervention, PLs provided open-ended feedback and participated in focus groups designed to explore intervention impact. Hypertensive PLs improved their systolic blood pressure and hypertension knowledge and increased their fruit/vegetable intake and pedometer use. We found no differences between PLs and PRs. PLs improved knowledge and increased fruit/vegetable intake more than intervention recipients did; they provided specific examples of personal health behavior change and knowledge acquisition. Individuals who volunteer to be peer health leaders are likely to receive important benefits even if they do not actually take on such a role."

aS"The purpose of this study was to identify rates of adherence for three outpatient quality indicators noted by Wang et al. (Pediatrics 2011;128:484\xe2\x80\x93493): (1) influenza vaccine, (2) pneumococcal immunizations, and (3)penicillin prophylaxis in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) in a Medicaid sample. These variables were chosen based on Wang and colleagues' suggestion that these variables are important for the assessment of the quality of care of children with SCD. We hypothesized that the overall rate of adherence would be poor with adults having worse rates of adherence than children. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Wisconsin State Medicaid database over a 5-year period to assess the preventative medication adherence of individuals with SCD. Preventative medication variables in this study included influenza vaccination,pneumococcal immunizations (PCV7, PPV23), and penicillin prophylaxis. As predicted, the 2003\xe2\x80\x932007 Wisconsin State Medicaid database showed patients with SCD had low adherence in terms of recommended influenza vaccinations (21.58% adherent), PPV23 pneumococcal immunizations (43.47% adherent), and penicillin prophylaxis (18.18% adherent). Pneumococcal immunizations for PCV7 were higher than expected (77.27%adherent). Although children tended to adhere to recommended preventative medications more than adults,overall adherence was low. Although we cannot explain why adherence is low, it is likely due to multiple factors at the patient- and provider-level. We encourage patients and providers to create a partnership to meet adherence recommendations, and we describe our strategies for increasing adherence."

aS'Observational studies of patients with rheumatoid arthritis have suggested that racial and ethnic disparities exist for minority populations. We compared disease activity and clinical outcomes across racial and ethnic groups using data from a large, contemporary US registry.We analyzed data from 2 time periods (2005-2007 and 2010-2012). The Clinical Disease Activity Index was examined as both a continuous measure and a dichotomous measure of disease activity states. Outcomes were compared in a series of cross-sectional and longitudinal multivariable regression models.For 2005-2007, significant differences of mean disease activity level (P < .001) were observed across racial and ethnic groups. Over the 5-year period, modest improvements in disease activity were observed across all groups, including whites (3.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.2-4.1) compared with African Americans (4.3; 95% CI, 2.7-5.8) and Hispanics (2.7; 95% CI, 1.2-4.3). For 2010-2012, significant differences of mean disease activity level persisted (P < .046) across racial and ethnic groups, ranging from 11.6 (95% CI, 10.4-12.8) in Hispanics to 10.7 (95% CI, 9.6-11.7) in whites. Remission rates remained significantly different across racial/ethnic groups across all models for 2010-2012, ranging from 22.7 (95% CI, 19.5-25.8) in African Americans to 27.4 (95% CI, 24.9-29.8) in whites.Despite improvements in disease activity across racial and ethnic groups over a 5-year period, disparities persist in disease activity and clinical outcomes for minority groups versus white patients.'

aS'To induce consumers to purchase healthier foods and beverages, some policymakers have suggested special taxes or labels on unhealthy products. The potential of such policies is unknown.In a controlled field experiment, researchers tested whether consumers were more likely to purchase healthy products under such policies.From October to December 2011, researchers opened a store at a large hospital that sold a variety of healthier and less-healthy foods and beverages. Purchases (N=3680) were analyzed under five conditions: a baseline with no special labeling or taxation, a 30% tax, highlighting the phrase "less healthy" on the price tag, and combinations of taxation and labeling. Purchases were analyzed in January-July 2012, at the single-item and transaction levels.There was no significant difference between the various taxation conditions. Consumers were 11 percentage points more likely to purchase a healthier item under a 30% tax (95% CI=7%, 16%, p<0.001) and 6 percentage points more likely under labeling (95% CI=0%, 12%, p=0.04). By product type, consumers switched away from the purchase of less-healthy food under taxation (9 percentage point decrease, p<0.001) and into healthier beverages (6 percentage point increase, p=0.001); there were no effects for labeling. Conditions were associated with the purchase of 11-14 fewer calories (9%-11% in relative terms) and 2 fewer grams of sugar. Results remained significant controlling for all items purchased in a single transaction.Taxation may induce consumers to purchase healthier foods and beverages. However, it is unclear whether the 15%-20% tax rates proposed in public policy discussions would be more effective than labeling products as less healthy.'

aS'Critically ill, morbidly obese patients (BMI\xe2\x89\xa540 kg/m2) are at high risk of respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). It is not clear if outcomes of critically ill, obese patients are affected by obesity. Due to limited cardiopulmonary reserve, they may have poor outcomes. However, literature to this effect is limited and conflicted.We used the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 2004 to 2008 to examine the outcomes of morbidly obese people receiving IMV and compared them to nonobese people. We identified hospitalizations requiring IMV and morbid obesity using International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification codes. Primary outcomes studied were inhospital mortality, rates of prolonged mechanical ventilation (\xe2\x89\xa596 h), and tracheostomy. Multivariable logistic regression was used to adjust for potential confounding variables. We also examined outcomes stratified by number of organs failing.Of all hospitalized, morbidly obese people, 2.9% underwent IMV. Mean age, comorbidity score, and severity of illness were lower in morbidly obese people. The adjusted mortality was not significantly different in morbidly obese people (OR 0.89; 95% CI, 0.74-1.06). When stratified by severity of disease, there was a stepwise increase in risk for mortality among morbidly obese people relative to nonobese people (range: OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.58-1.01 for only respiratory failure, to OR, 4.14; 95% CI, 1.11-15.3 for four or more organs failing). Rates of prolonged mechanical ventilation were similar, but rate of tracheostomy (OR 2.19; 95% CI, 1.77-2.69) was significantly higher in patients who were morbidly obese.Morbidly obese people undergoing IMV have a similar risk for death as nonobese people if only respiratory failure is present. When more organs fail, morbidly obese people have increased risk for mortality compared with nonobese people.'

aS'Prostate cancer (PCa) racial disparity studies typically focus on survival differences after curative treatment. The authors of this report hypothesized that comparing mortality rates between African American (AA) and Caucasian American (CA) patients who deferred primary treatment for clinically nonmetastatic PCa may provide a better assessment of the impact of race on the natural course of PCa.The pathology database of the New York Veterans Administration Medical Center (VAMC), an equal access-of-care facility, was searched for patients with biopsy-proven PCa. Inclusion criteria included 1) no evidence of metastatic disease or death within 3 years after diagnosis, 2) no primary treatment, and 3) a minimum of 5 years of follow-up for survivors.In total, 518 patients met inclusion criteria between 1990 and 2005. AA patients were younger (P = .02) and had higher median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels (P = .001) at the time of diagnosis compared with CA patients. In a multivariate model, higher Gleason score and PSA level were associated with increased mortality (P = .001 and P = .03, respectively), but race was not a predictor of death from PCa.The current data suggested that race did not have a major impact on survival in patients with PCa who deferred primary treatment for clinically nonmetastatic disease.'

aS'We compared a statewide telephone health survey with electronic health record (EHR) data from a large Wisconsin health system to estimate asthma prevalence in Wisconsin.We developed frequency tables and logistic regression models using Wisconsin Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and University of Wisconsin primary care clinic data. We compared adjusted odds ratios (AORs) from each model.Between 2007 and 2009, the EHR database contained 376,000 patients (30,000 with asthma), and 23,000 (1850 with asthma) responded to the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System telephone survey. AORs for asthma were similar in magnitude and direction for the majority of covariates, including gender, age, and race/ethnicity, between survey and EHR models. The EHR data had greater statistical power to detect associations than did survey data, especially in pediatric and ethnic populations, because of larger sample sizes.EHRs can be used to estimate asthma prevalence in Wisconsin adults and children. EHR data may improve public health chronic disease surveillance using high-quality data at the local level to better identify areas of disparity and risk factors and guide education and health care interventions.'

aS"Age-related disparities in colon cancer treatment exist, with older patients being less likely to receive recommended therapy. However, to the authors' knowledge, few studies to date have focused on receipt of surgery. The objective of the current study was to describe patterns of surgery in patients aged \xe2\x89\xa5 80 years with colon cancer and examine outcomes with and without colectomy.Medicare beneficiaries aged \xe2\x89\xa5 80 years with colon cancer who were diagnosed between 1992 and 2005 were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess factors associated with nonoperative management. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis determined 1-year overall and colon cancer-specific survival.Of 31,574 patients, 80% underwent colectomy. Approximately 46% were diagnosed during an urgent/emergent hospital admission, with decreased 1-year overall survival (70% vs 86% for patients diagnosed during an elective admission) noted among these individuals. Factors found to be most predictive of nonoperative management included older age, black race, more hospital admissions, use of home oxygen, use of a wheelchair, being frail, and having dementia. For both operative and nonoperative patients, the 1-year overall survival rate was lower than the colon cancer-specific survival rate (operative patients: 78% vs 89%; nonoperative patients: 58% vs 78%).The majority of older patients with colon cancer undergo surgery, with improved outcomes noted compared with nonoperative management. However, many patients who are not selected for surgery die of unrelated causes, reflecting good surgical selection. Patients undergoing surgery during an urgent/emergent admission have an increased short-term mortality risk. Because the earlier detection of colon cancer may increase the percentage of older patients undergoing elective surgery, the findings of the current study may have policy implications for colon cancer screening and suggest that age should not be the only factor driving cancer screening recommendations."

aS'Most studies on the provision of dental procedures have focused on Medicaid enrollees known to have inadequate access to dental care. Little information on private insurance enrollees exists. This study documents the rates of preventive, restorative, endodontic, and surgical dental procedures provided to children enrolled in Delta Dental of Wisconsin (DDWI) in Milwaukee.We analyzed DDWI claims data for Milwaukee children aged 0-18 years between 2002 and 2008. We linked the ZIP codes of enrollees to the 2000 U.S. Census information to derive racial/ethnic estimates in the different ZIP codes. We estimated the rates of preventive, restorative, endodontic, and surgical procedures provided to children in different racial/ethnic groups based on the population estimates derived from the U.S. Census data. Descriptive and multivariable analysis was done using Poisson regression modeling on dental procedures per year.In 7 years, a total of 266,380 enrollees were covered in 46 ZIP codes in the database. Approximately, 64\xe2\x80\x83percent, 44\xe2\x80\x83percent, and 49\xe2\x80\x83percent of White, African American, and Hispanic children had at least one dental visit during the study period, respectively. The rates of preventive procedures increased up to the age of 9 years and decreased thereafter among children in all three racial groups included in the analysis. African American and Hispanic children received half as many preventive procedures as White children.Our study shows that substantial racial disparities may exist in the types of dental procedures that were received by children.'

aS'To test the hypothesis that a relative deficiency in L-arginine, the substrate for synthesis of the vasodilatory gas nitric oxide, may be associated with the development of pre-eclampsia in a population at high risk.Randomised, blinded, placebo controlled clinical trial.Tertiary public hospital in Mexico City.Pregnant women with a history of a previous pregnancy complicated by pre-eclampsia, or pre-eclampsia in a first degree relative, and deemed to be at increased risk of recurrence of the disease were studied from week 14-32 of gestation and followed until delivery.Supplementation with a medical food-bars containing L-arginine plus antioxidant vitamins, antioxidant vitamins alone, or placebo-during pregnancy.Development of pre-eclampsia/eclampsia.222 women were allocated to the placebo group, 228 received L-arginine plus antioxidant vitamins, and 222 received antioxidant vitamins alone. Women had 4-8 prenatal visits while receiving the bars. The incidence of pre-eclampsia was reduced significantly (\xcf\x87(2) = 19.41; P < 0.001) in women randomised to L-arginine plus antioxidant vitamins compared with placebo (absolute risk reduction 0.17 (95% confidence interval 0.12 to 0.21). Antioxidant vitamins alone showed an observed benefit, but this effect was not statistically significant compared with placebo (\xcf\x87(2) = 3.76; P = 0.052; absolute risk reduction 0.07, 0.005 to 0.15). L-arginine plus antioxidant vitamins compared with antioxidant vitamins alone resulted in a significant effect (P = 0.004; absolute risk reduction 0.09, 0.05 to 0.14).Supplementation during pregnancy with a medical food containing L-arginine and antioxidant vitamins reduced the incidence of pre-eclampsia in a population at high risk of the condition. Antioxidant vitamins alone did not have a protective effect for prevention of pre-eclampsia. Supplementation with L-arginine plus antioxidant vitamins needs to be evaluated in a low risk population to determine the generalisability of the protective effect, and the relative contributions of L-arginine and antioxidant vitamins to the observed effects of the combined treatment need to be determined.

aS'Primary malignant melanoma arising from the eustachian tube is extremely rare. We report the case of a 63-year-old white man who presented with a 1-month history of left-sided hearing loss and aural fullness. Flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy detected a blue-purple mass that appeared to arise from the left lateral nasopharynx. Computed tomography demonstrated an enhancing mass arising from an orifice of the left eustachian tube. The tumor was debulked endoscopically and was confirmed to have originated in the left eustachian tube. Histologically, the tumor was made up of heavily pigmented pleomorphic spindle cells with frequent mitoses. The tumor cells were immunohistochemically positive for S-100 protein, HMB-45, Melan-A, and PNL-2. The final diagnosis was a mucosal malignant melanoma. We also performed a nested polymerase chain reaction assay for several genes of interest, including CTLA-4, IL-17A, IL-17B, IL-17C, IL-17D, IL-17E, IL-17F, PLZF, Foxp3, ROR\xce\xb3t, CD27, and CD70. These genes have been studied mainly in cutaneous melanomas, especially for the development of immunotherapy, but only very limited studies have been done on mucosal melanomas. Our investigation found upregulation of CTLA-4, IL-17A, IL-17C, and IL-17E. Based on our finding of CTLA-4 upregulation, it may be suggested that our patient might have had low antitumor immunity and that he might have benefited from CTLA-4 blockade. On the other hand, upregulation of IL-17A and IL-17E might reflect increased antitumor immunity, which could suggest that patients with a mucosal melanoma might benefit from immunomodulators associated with the effect of Th17. These genes also have great potential to help melanoma patients obtain tailored treatment, and they can be used as biomarkers for predicting prognosis.'

aS'Although the importance of research mentorship has been well established, the role of mentors of junior clinical and translational science investigators is not clearly defined. The authors attempt to derive a list of actionable competencies for mentors from a series of complementary methods. We examined focus groups, the literature, competencies derived for clinical and translational scholars, mentor training curricula, mentor evaluation forms and finally conducted an expert panel process in order to compose this list. These efforts resulted in a set of competencies that include generic competencies expected of all mentors, competencies specific to scientists, and competencies that are clinical and translational research specific. They are divided into six thematic areas: (1) Communication and managing the relationship, (2) Psychosocial support, (3) Career and professional development, (4) Professional enculturation and scientific integrity, (5) Research development, and (6) Clinical and translational investigator development. For each thematic area, we have listed associated competencies, 19 in total. For each competency, we list examples that are actionable and measurable. Although a comprehensive approach was used to derive this list of competencies, further work will be required to parse out how to apply and adapt them, as well future research directions and evaluation processes.'

aS"The aging process is marked by a series of transitions that influence multiple domains of well-being. One important transition for older adults is the process of driving cessation. Numerous studies have examined risk factors for driving cessation among older adults to identify at-risk older drivers for road safety. Recent research has focused on the consequences of driving cessation in later life for health and well-being. However, these reports have been largely empirical and are not drawn from a defined conceptual framework. Establishing a theoretical model of 'how driving cessation interacts with other processes and domains of aging' will promote synthesis of seemingly disparate findings and also link the empirical research on cessation to the broader field of gerontology. This article describes a conceptual model for articulating and examining the components of the driving cessation process based on the stress-coping paradigm. This model situates driving cessation within the context of exogenous stressors, individual vulnerabilities and coping strategies, and environmental hazards and buffers over the lifespan. This model could assist in guiding intervention strategies aimed at reducing premature driving cessation in older drivers with ameliorable impairments while assisting at-risk older drivers to reduce or stop driving in a less stressful way."

aS'Community-based outpatient experiences are a core component of the clinical years in medical school. Central to the success of this experience is the recruitment and retention of volunteer faculty from the community. Prior studies have identified reasons why some preceptors volunteer their time however, there is a paucity of data comparing those who volunteer from those who do not.A survey was developed following a review of previous studies addressing perceptions of community-based preceptors. A non-parametric, Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare active preceptors (APs) and inactive preceptors (IPs) and all data were analyzed in SPSS 20.0.There was a 28% response rate. Preceptors showed similar demographic characteristics, valued intrinsic over extrinsic benefits, and appreciated Continuing Medical Education (CME)/Maintenance of Certification (MOC) opportunities as the highest extrinsic reward. APs were more likely to also precept at the M1/M2 level and value recognition and faculty development opportunities (p<0.05). IPs denoted time as the most significant barrier and, in comparison to APs, rated financial compensation as more important (p<0.05).Community preceptors are motivated by intrinsic benefits of teaching. Efforts to recruit should initially focus on promoting awareness of teaching opportunities and offering CME/MOC opportunities. Increasing the pool of preceptors may require financial compensation.'

aS"Evidence suggests that when carefully implemented, health information technologies (HIT) have a positive impact on behavior, as well as operational, process, and clinical outcomes. Recent economic stimulus initiatives have prompted unprecedented federal investment in HIT. Despite strong interest from the healthcare delivery community to achieve 'meaningful use' of HIT within a relatively short time frame, few best-practice implementation methodologies have been described. Herein we outline HIT implementation strategies at an academic health center with an office of clinical transformation. Seven percent of the medical center's information technology budget was dedicated to the Office of Clinical Transformation, and successful conversion of 1491 physicians to electronic-based documentation was accomplished. This paper outlines the process re-design, end-user adoption, and practice transformation strategies that resulted in a 99.7% adoption rate within 6&emsp14;months of the introduction of digital documentation."

aS'The treatment of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is complex and therapeutic regimens vary according to the acuity of presentation and the goals of therapy. Most treatments for HE rely on manipulating the intestinal milieu and therefore antibiotics that act on the gut form a key treatment strategy. Prominent antibiotics studied in HE are neomycin, metronidazole, vancomycin and rifaximin. For the management of the acute episode, all antibiotics have been tested. However the limited numbers studied, adverse effects (neomycin oto- and nephrotoxicity, metronidazole neurotoxicity) and potential for resistance emergence (vancomycin-resistant enterococcus) has limited the use of most antibiotics, apart from rifaximin which has the greatest evidence base. Rifaximin has also demonstrated, in conjunction with lactulose, to prevent overt HE recurrence in a multi-center, randomized trial. Despite its cost in the US, rifaximin may prove cost-saving by preventing hospitalizations for overt HE. In minimal/covert HE, rifaximin is the only systematically studied antibiotic. Rifaximin showed improvement in cognition, inflammation, quality-of-life and driving simulator performance but cost-analysis does not favor its use at the current time. Antibiotics, especially rifaximin, have a definite role in the management across the spectrum of HE.'

aS'Sexual debut before age 15 years has been associated with increased sexual risk behaviors among teens, but little is known about its effects beyond adolescence. This study examines the relationship between the age at first intercourse and subsequent contraceptive gaps.We identified 3538 sexually active, fertile women participants from the 2006-2008 National Survey of Family Growth. Women were classified as consistent contraceptive users or inconsistent/nonusers. Age at first intercourse with a man was determined by self-report and categorized as <15, 15-17, and \xe2\x89\xa518 years.Twenty-three percent reported gaps in contraceptive use in the year prior to interview. Compared with women who were 18 or older at first intercourse, women who were <15 years of age at the time of first intercourse were nearly two times as likely to report a gap in contraceptive use (adjusted odds ratio: 1.93; 95% confidence interval: 1.23-3.00).Age at first intercourse is associated with inconsistent or nonuse of contraceptives in later life. Primary prevention efforts should be established to empower girls to make informed and autonomous decisions about sexual debut. Personalized contraceptive counseling has been demonstrated as being effective in increasing contraceptive use and compliance and should be offered to all women, with particular focus on women who report an early age at first intercourse or other factors associated with inconsistent contraceptive use.'

aS'Utilize high-resolution imaging to examine retinal anatomy in patients with known genetic relative risk (RR) for developing age-related macular degeneration (AMD).Forty asymptomatic subjects were recruited (9 men, 31 women; age range, 51 to 69 years; mean age, 61.4 years). Comprehensive eye examination, fundus photography, and high-resolution retinal imaging using spectral domain optical coherence tomography and adaptive optics were performed on each patient. Genetic RR scores were developed using an age-independent algorithm. Adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscope images were acquired in the macula extending to 10 degrees temporal and superior from fixation and were used to calculate cone density in up to 35 locations for each subject.Relative risk was not significantly predictive of fundus grade (p = 0.98). Only patients with a high RR displayed drusen on Cirrus or Bioptigen OCT. Compared to an eye with a grade of 0, an eye with a fundus grade equal to or greater than 1 had a 12% decrease in density (p < 0.0001) and a 5% increase in spacing (p = 0.0014). No association between genetic RR and either cone density (p = 0.435) or spacing (p = 0.538) was found. Three distinct adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscope phenotypical variations of photoreceptor appearance were noted in patients with grade 1 to 3 fundi. These included variable reflectivity of photoreceptors, decreased waveguiding, and altered photoreceptor mosaic overlying drusen.Our data demonstrate the potential of multimodal assessment in the understanding of early anatomical changes associated with AMD. Adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscope imaging reveals a decrease in photoreceptor density and increased spacing in patients with grade 1 to 3 fundi, as well as a spectrum of photoreceptor changes, ranging from variability in reflectivity to decreased density. Future longitudinal studies are needed in genetically characterized subjects to assess the significance of these findings with respect to the development and progression of AMD.'

aS'Idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (DILI) can be caused by intravenous (IV) medications, but the characteristics of DILI caused by these agents are not known. The aim of this study is to characterize the clinical features of subjects with suspected DILI associated with IV agents enrolled into the Drug Induced Liver Injury Network Prospective Study.Subjects with suspected DILI due to IV medications with probable, highly likely, or definite casuality scores were eligible.Between 2004 and October 2010, 542 cases of DILI were adjudicated for causality, of which 32 were eligible for inclusion in this study. DILI was ascribed to a single IV agent in 27 subjects, and to multiple IV agents in 5 subjects. Antimicrobial agents (62%), antineoplastic agents (16%), and phenytoin (9%) were most commonly implicated. The pattern of liver injury was hepatocellular in 30%, mixed in 33%, and cholestatic in 37%. The peak alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (AlkP), and total bilirubin were 686 \xc2\xb1 915 U/L, 623 \xc2\xb1 563 U/L, and 8.7 \xc2\xb1 10.3 mg/dL, respectively. The duration for \xe2\x89\xa5 50% improvement from peak ALT, AlkP, and total bilirubin were 25 \xc2\xb1 37, 59 \xc2\xb1 69, and 20 \xc2\xb1 28 days, respectively. DILI severity was mild in 37%, moderate in 47%, severe in 13%, and fatal in 3%, with no liver transplantation. Their causality was adjudicated as definite in 5, very likely in 17, and probable in 10 subjects. The frequency of chronic DILI was 13%.Antimicrobial and antineoplastic agents are the most common IV agents to cause DILI. DILI ascribed to IV agents is relatively infrequent, but its outcomes are similar to those of the overall Drug Induced Liver Injury Network cohort.'

aS'To validate a T(1)-independent, T(2)*-corrected fat quantification technique that uses accurate spectral modeling of fat using a homogeneous fat-water-SPIO phantom over physiologically expected ranges of fat percentage and T(2)* decay in the presence of iron overload.A homogeneous gel phantom consisting of vials with known fat-fractions and iron concentrations is described. Fat-fraction imaging was performed using a multiecho chemical shift-based fat-water separation method (IDEAL), and various reconstructions were performed to determine the impact of T(2)* correction and accurate spectral modeling. Conventional two-point Dixon (in-phase/out-of-phase) imaging and MR spectroscopy were performed for comparison with known fat-fractions.The best agreement with known fat-fractions over the full range of iron concentrations was found when T(2)* correction and accurate spectral modeling were used. Conventional two-point Dixon imaging grossly underestimated fat-fraction for all T(2)* values, but particularly at higher iron concentrations.This work demonstrates the necessity of T(2)* correction and accurate spectral modeling of fat to accurately quantify fat using MRI.'

aS'Fish and \xcf\x89-3 fatty acids are reported to be beneficial in pediatric nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), but no studies have assessed their relation to histological severity. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the dietary intake of fish and \xcf\x89-3 fatty acids in children with biopsy-proven NAFLD, and examine their association with serological and histological indicators of disease.This was a cross-sectional analysis of 223 children (6-18 years) who participated in the Treatment of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Children trial or the NAFLD Database study conducted by the Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Clinical Research Network. The distribution of fish and \xcf\x89-3 fatty acid intake was determined from responses to the Block Brief 2000 Food Frequency Questionnaire, and analyzed for associations with serum alanine aminotransferase, histological features of fatty liver disease, and diagnosis of steatohepatitis after adjusting for demographic, anthropometric, and dietary variables.The minority of subjects consumed the recommended 8 ounces of fish per week (22/223 [10%]) and 200 mg of long-chain \xcf\x89-3 fatty acids per day (12/223 [5%]). Lack of fish and long-chain \xcf\x89-3 fatty acid intake was associated with greater portal (P = 0.03 and P = 0.10, respectively) and lobular inflammation (P = 0.09 and P = 0.004, respectively) after controlling for potential confounders.Fish and \xcf\x89-3 fatty acid intake was insufficient in children with NAFLD, which may increase susceptibility to hepatic inflammation. Patients with pediatric NAFLD should be encouraged to consume the recommended amount of fish per week.'

aS'Sickle cell disease (SCD) pain is associated with colder temperatures and touch and described as "cold," "hot," and "shooting" suggesting hypersensitivity to tactile stimuli. Sickle mice exhibit hypersensitivity to thermal (cold, heat) and mechanical stimuli compared to controls. It is unknown whether humans experience this same hypersensitivity. Thus, we quantified thermal and mechanical sensitivity differences between patients with SCD and controls. Our primary hypothesis was that patients with SCD will exhibit hypersensitivity to thermal and mechanical stimuli compared to race-matched controls. Our secondary hypothesis was this hypersensitivity will be associated with older and female subjects, and with frequent pain and hemolysis in patients with SCD. A total of 55 patients and 57 controls \xe2\x89\xa57 years completed quantitative sensory testing. Patients with SCD detected the sensation of cold and warm temperatures sooner as seen in their significantly lower median cold and heat detection thresholds [29.5\xc2\xb0C vs. 28.6\xc2\xb0C, P = 0.012 and 34.5\xc2\xb0C vs. 35.3\xc2\xb0C, P = 0.02] and experienced cold and heat pain sooner as seen in their significantly lower median cold and heat pain thresholds [21.1\xc2\xb0C vs. 14.8\xc2\xb0C, P = 0.01 and 42.7\xc2\xb0C vs. 45.2\xc2\xb0C, P = 0.04]. We found no mechanical threshold differences. Older age was associated with lower cold, heat, and mechanical pain thresholds in both groups. No association with pain, gender, or hemolysis was found. Patients with SCD exhibit hypersensitivity to thermal stimuli suggesting peripheral or central sensitization may exist and could contribute to SCD pain.'

aS'Nuclear EGFR (nEGFR) has been identified in various human tumor tissues, including cancers of the breast, ovary, oropharynx, and esophagus, and has predicted poor patient outcomes. We sought to determine if protein expression of nEGFR is prognostic in early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Resected stages I and II NSCLC specimens were evaluated for nEGFR protein expression using immunohistochemistry (IHC). Cases with at least one replicate core containing \xe2\x89\xa55% of tumor cells demonstrating strong dot-like nucleolar EGFR expression were scored as nEGFR positive.Twenty-three (26.1% of the population) of 88 resected specimens stained positively for nEGFR. Nuclear EGFR protein expression was associated with higher disease stage (45.5% of stage II vs. 14.5% of stage I; p = 0.023), histology (41.7% in squamous cell carcinoma vs. 17.1% in adenocarcinoma; p = 0.028), shorter progression-free survival (PFS) (median PFS 8.7 months [95% CI 5.1-10.7 mo] for nEGFR positive vs. 14.5 months [95% CI 9.5-17.4 mo] for nEGFR negative; hazard ratio (HR) of 1.89 [95% CI 1.15-3.10]; p = 0.011), and shorter overall survival (OS) (median OS 14.1 months [95% CI 10.3-22.7 mo] for nEGFR positive vs. 23.4 months [95% CI 20.1-29.4 mo] for nEGFR negative; HR of 1.83 [95% CI 1.12-2.99]; p = 0.014).Expression of nEGFR protein was associated with higher stage and squamous cell histology, and predicted shorter PFS and OS, in this patient cohort. Nuclear EGFR serves as a useful independent prognostic variable and as a potential therapeutic target in NSCLC.'

aS'Sinonasal mucosal melanomas (SNMM) of the head and neck regions are rare and aggressive malignancies. Although they can affect patients of any ethnicity, they are more numerous in Chinese patients. The diagnosis and treatment of these tumors can be challenging. Recent studies have reported that Sox10 is a sensitive melanocytic marker for cutaneous melanoma (Nonaka et al. in Am J Surg Pathol 32:1291-1298, 2008). In addition, a CD117 (c-kit) gene mutation has been identified in cutaneous melanomas, indicating that there may be potential therapeutic benefits of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as Imatinib. The purpose of this study was to detect and test the immunohistochemical expression of Sox10 and c-kit in mucosal melanomas (MM) arising in the nasal cavities of Chinese patients. Twenty eight patients with mucosal melanomas of the nasal cavity were treated in two major hospitals in China. All cases had been locally diagnosed as primary SNMM. We confirmed all diagnoses with positive immunohistochemical stains for S100 and HMB-45. Additionally, automated immunohistochemistry was performed using a goat polyclonal Sox10 antibody and a monoclonal c-kit antibody counterstained using a standard avidin-biotin complex method. Immunohistochemical positive expression of Sox10 was defined by nuclear stain; and positivity for c-kit resulted in a distinct membranous staining. The extent of nuclear positivity for Sox10 and membranous stain for c-kit was graded by 4 board certified pathologists as follows: 1+, 1-25\xc2\xa0% of positive tumor cells; 2+, 25-50\xc2\xa0%; 3+, 50-75\xc2\xa0%; and 4+, \xe2\x89\xa575\xc2\xa0%. Sox10 nuclear expression was found in all cases (100\xc2\xa0%), with 4+ staining in 26 out of 28 cases (92.8\xc2\xa0%) and 3+ staining in two cases with (7.1\xc2\xa0%). The overall positivity for S100 staining was 23 out of 28 (82.1\xc2\xa0%), with 1+ staining in 10 cases, 2+ staining in 6 cases, 3+ staining in 7 cases, and no staining in 5 cases. The sensitivity and intensity of Sox10 immunohistochemistry were both higher than with S100 immunohistochemistry. Immunopositivity of membranous stain for c-kit (CD117) was seen in 24 out of 28 cases (85.7\xc2\xa0%), including 6 tumors that were 4+, eight that were 3+, six that were 2+, and four that showed 1+ staining. Our results demonstrate that Sox10 is a sensitive marker for SNMM and it may possess diagnostic value in addition to that of S100 protein. The expression of c-kit in the majority of MMs suggests that it may be useful in the assessment of these tumors for potential treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.'

aS'We evaluated the association between two aspects of social relationships and six inflammatory markers in Taiwan and the U.S. These two countries share similar levels of current life expectancy, but exhibit important differences in social structure. The data comprised population based samples from Taiwan (aged 53+; n=962) and the U.S. (aged 35-86; n=990) collected between 2003 and 2009. Circulating levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, and soluble forms of intercellular adhesion molecule 1, E-selectin, and IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) were measured in fasting blood samples. A social integration score was based on marital status, contact with family and friends, church attendance, and other social participation. A perceived social support index was based on questions regarding the availability of care and support from family and friends. Linear regression models tested the association between these two measures and each inflammatory marker controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, obesity, medication use, and baseline health status. After adjusting for potential confounders, social integration had a significant but weak inverse association with CRP in Taiwan. Perceived social support was significant in two of 12 models, and the coefficient was positive (i.e., higher support was associated with higher CRP and sIL-6R in the U.S.). We found no evidence that the coefficients for social relationship measures varied by sex or age. Our results yielded limited evidence of a weak association between two dimensions of social relationships and six inflammatory markers in Taiwan and the U.S. Given that the literature suggests a strong link between social relationships and mortality, and that inflammation plays an important role in the leading causes of death, we had expected to find consistent and moderately strong associations between social relationships and inflammatory markers. The small effect sizes and lack of robustness across markers were surprising.'

aS'Biomonitoring of industrial chemicals in human tissues and fluids has shown that all people carry a "body burden" of synthetic chemicals. Although measurement of an environmental chemical in a person\'s tissues/fluids is an indication of exposure, it does not necessarily mean the exposure concentration is sufficient to cause an adverse effect. Since humans are exposed to multiple chemicals, there may be a combination effect (e.g., additive, synergistic) associated with low-level exposures to multiple classes of contaminants, which may impact a variety of organ systems. The objective of this research is to link measures of body burden of environmental chemicals and a "holistic" measure of wellness. The approach is demonstrated using biomonitoring data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES). Forty-two chemicals were selected for analysis based on their detection levels. Six biological pathway-specific indices were evaluated using groups of chemicals associated with each pathway. Five of the six pathways were negatively associated with wellness. Three non-zero interaction terms were detected which may provide empirical evidence of crosstalk across pathways. The approach identified five of the 42 chemicals from a variety of classes (metals, pesticides, furans, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) as accounting for 71% of the weight linking body burden to wellness. Significant interactions were detected indicating the effect of smoking is exacerbated by body burden of environmental chemicals. Use of a holistic index on both sides of the exposure-health equation is a novel and promising empirical "systems biology" approach to risk evaluation of complex environmental exposures.'

aS'To examine the relationship between job strain and two indicators of mental health, depression and alcohol misuse, among currently employed older adults.Data come from the 2004 and 2006 waves of the Health and Retirement Study (N = 2,902). Multivariable logistic regression modeling was used to determine the association between job strain, indicated by the imbalance of job stress and job satisfaction, with depression and alcohol misuse.High job strain (indicated by high job stress combined with low job satisfaction) was associated with elevated depressive symptoms (odds ratio [OR] = 2.98, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.99-4.45) relative to low job strain after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, labor force status, and occupation. High job stress combined with high job satisfaction (OR = 1.93) and low job stress combined with low job satisfaction (OR = 1.94) were also associated with depressive symptoms to a lesser degree. Job strain was unrelated to either moderate or heavy drinking. These associations did not vary by gender or age.Job strain is associated with elevated depressive symptoms among older workers. In contrast to results from investigations of younger workers, job strain was unrelated to alcohol misuse. These findings can inform the development and implementation of workplace health promotion programs that reflect the mental health needs of the aging workforce.'

aS'This study characterized the brain electrical activity during pedaling, a locomotor-like task, in humans. We postulated that phasic brain activity would be associated with active pedaling, consistent with a cortical role in locomotor tasks.Sixty four channels of electroencephalogram (EEG) and 10 channels of electromyogram (EMG) data were recorded from 10 neurologically-intact volunteers while they performed active and passive (no effort) pedaling on a custom-designed stationary bicycle. Ensemble averaged waveforms, 2 dimensional topographic maps and amplitude of the \xce\xb2 (13-35 Hz) frequency band were analyzed and compared between active and passive trials.The peak-to-peak amplitude (peak positive-peak negative) of the EEG waveform recorded at the Cz electrode was higher in the passive than the active trials (p < 0.01). \xce\xb2-band oscillations in electrodes overlying the leg representation area of the cortex were significantly desynchronized during active compared to the passive pedaling (p < 0.01). A significant negative correlation was observed between the average EEG waveform for active trials and the composite EMG (summated EMG from both limbs for each muscle) of the rectus femoris (r = -0.77, p < 0.01) the medial hamstrings (r = -0.85, p < 0.01) and the tibialis anterior (r = -0.70, p < 0.01) muscles.These results demonstrated that substantial sensorimotor processing occurs in the brain during pedaling in humans. Further, cortical activity seemed to be greatest during recruitment of the muscles critical for transitioning the legs from flexion to extension and vice versa.This is the first study demonstrating the feasibility of EEG recording during pedaling, and owing to similarities between pedaling and bipedal walking, may provide valuable insight into brain activity during locomotion in humans.'

aS'Stress and associated alterations in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function have deleterious influence on the development of multiple mental and physical health problems. Prior research has aimed to identify individuals most at risk for the development of these stress-related maladies by examining factors that may contribute to inter-individual differences in HPA responses to acute stress. The objectives of this study were to investigate, in adolescents, (1) whether differences in neurocognitive abilities influenced cortisol reactivity to an acute stressor, (2) whether internalizing psychiatric disorders influenced this relationship, and (3) whether acute cognitive stress-appraisal mechanisms mediated an association between neurocognitive function and cortisol reactivity. Subjects were 70 adolescents from a community sample who underwent standardized neurocognitive assessments of IQ, achievement, and declarative memory measures at mean age 14 and whose physiological and behavioral responses to a standardized psychosocial stress paradigm (Trier Social Stress Test, TSST) were assessed at mean age 18. Results showed that, among all adolescents, lower nonverbal memory performance predicted lower cortisol reactivity. In addition, internalizing disorders interacted with verbal memory such that the association with cortisol reactivity was strongest for adolescents with internalizing disorders. Finally, lower secondary cognitive appraisal of coping in anticipation of the TSST independently predicted lower cortisol reactivity but did not mediate the neurocognitive-cortisol relationship. Findings suggest that declarative memory may contribute to inter-individual differences in acute cortisol reactivity in adolescents, internalizing disorders may influence this relationship, and cognitive stress appraisal also predicts cortisol reactivity. Developmental, research, and clinical implications are discussed.'

aS"This study examined cancer survivors' experience of and responses to challenges and stressors associated with everyday living. The impact of daily stressors on quality of life concerns and cortisol patterns was also investigated.Participants included 111 cancer survivors who participated in a national telephone diary study of daily experiences (National Study of Daily Experiences). Their responses were compared with those of 111 sociodemographically matched participants with no cancer history using a multilevel modeling approach. Over an 8-day period, participants completed a daily inventory of the occurrence and impact of stressful events, affect, and physical symptoms. Salivary cortisol was sampled four times per day, and indices of awakening response (cortisol awakening response), diurnal slope, and overall output (area under the curve) were examined.Cancer survivors experienced similar numbers and types of stressful events as the comparison group. Although appraisals were largely comparable, cancer survivors showed a modest tendency to perceive stressors as more severe and disruptive, particularly those involving interpersonal tensions. The occurrence of stressors was associated with increased negative affect, decreased positive affect, and increased physical symptoms, but little change in cortisol. Relative to the comparison group, cancer survivors showed less pronounced changes in positive affect and cortisol output when stressors occurred, but a greater increase in negative affect in response to interpersonal conflicts.Findings indicate that cancer survivors show a resilient ability to respond to day-to-day stressors and challenges. However, daily stressors can have a significant impact on survivors' mood and physical symptoms and therefore may be an important intervention target."

aS'Angiogenesis and inflammation are both important to the pathogenesis of malignancies. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer causes drastic hormonal changes that alter both disease and host factors. We measured inflammatory and angiogenic biomarkers in ADT-treated and control groups of men with prostate cancer.Baseline and 12-week plasma samples were collected from 37 ADT-na\xc3\xafve men with locally advanced or recurrent prostate cancer. Of those, 23 initiated ADT with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist and 14 served as nontreatment controls. Samples were tested for a panel of angiogenic and inflammatory biomarkers.The treatment group had significantly higher concentrations of the inflammatory biomarkers interleukin (IL)-1\xce\xb2, IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\xce\xb1, and stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1\xce\xb1. None of the angiogenic biomarkers were significantly different between the groups at baseline. Among patients with a short prostate-specific antigen (PSA) doubling time (<6 months), the proangiogenic factor basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was lower at baseline. In the treatment group, plasma placental growth factor (PlGF) increased and IL-6 decreased after 12 weeks of ADT. Moreover, the treatment group continued to have significantly higher concentrations of the inflammatory biomarkers IL-1\xce\xb2, IL-8, and SDF-1\xce\xb1 as well as bFGF than controls.These men were characterized by elevations in several traditional markers of aggressive disease and also by higher levels of several inflammatory biomarkers. Although ADT decreased IL-6 levels, IL-1\xce\xb2, IL-8, and SDF-1\xce\xb1 remained significantly higher than in controls. The role of these biomarkers should be further explored.'

aS'To determine the number of genetic factors underlying the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for alcohol dependence (AD), we conducted structural equation twin modeling for seven AD criteria, plus two summary screening questions, in 7133 personally interviewed male and female twins from the Virginia Adult Twin Study of Psychiatric and Substance Use Disorders, who reported lifetime alcohol consumption. The best-fit twin model required three genetic and two unique environmental common factors, and criterion-specific unique environmental factors. The first genetic factor was defined by high loadings for the probe question about quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption, and tolerance criterion. The second genetic factor loaded strongly on the probe question about self-recognition of alcohol-related problems and AD criteria for loss of control, desire to quit, preoccupation and activities given up. The third genetic factor had high loadings for withdrawal and continued use despite the problems criteria. Genetic factor scores derived from these three factors differentially predicted patterns of comorbidity, educational status and other historical/clinical features of AD. The DSM-IV syndrome of AD does not reflect a single dimension of genetic liability, rather, these criteria reflect three underlying dimensions that index risk for: (i) tolerance and heavy use; (ii) loss of control with alcohol associated social dysfunction and (iii) withdrawal and continued use despite problems. While tentative and in need of replication, these results, consistent with the rodent literature, were validated by examining predictions of the genetic factor scores and have implications for gene-finding efforts in AD.'

aS'In patients with cirrhosis, cognitive dysfunction most often results from covert hepatic encephalopathy (HE). These patients are not tested routinely for cognitive dysfunction despite single-center evidence that it could be associated with poor socioeconomic status (SES). We investigated the association between SES and cognition in a multicenter study of cirrhosis.In a cross-sectional study, 236 cirrhotic patients from 3 centers (84 subjects from Virginia, 102\xc2\xa0from Ohio, and 50 from Rome, Italy; age 57.7 \xc2\xb1 8.6 y; 14% with prior overt HE) were given recommended cognitive tests and a validated SES questionnaire that included questions about employment, personal and family income, and overall financial security. Comparisons were made among centers and between subjects who were employed or not. Regression analysis was performed using employment and personal income as outcomes.Only 37% of subjects had been employed in the past year. Subjects had substantial financial insecurity-their yearly personal income ranged from $16,000 to $24,999, and their family income ranged from $25,000 to $49,999. They would be able to maintain a residence for only 3 to 6 months if their income stopped, and their current liquid assets were $500 to $4999 (<$500 if debt was subtracted). Cognition and SES were worst in Ohio and best in Virginia. Cognition correlated with personal and family income, within and between centers. On regression analysis, cognitive performance (digit symbol, lures, and line tracing) was associated with personal yearly income, after controlling for demographics, country, employment, and overt HE. Unemployed subjects had a higher rate of overt HE, worse cognition, and lower personal income than employed subjects. On regression analysis, performance on digit symbol, line tracing, inhibitory control test lures, and serial dotting tests remained associated with employment, similar to income.In an international multicenter study of patients with cirrhosis, socioeconomic condition, based on employment and personal income, was associated strongly with cognitive performance, independent of age, education, and country.'

aS'The FEBSTAT study is a prospective study that seeks to determine the acute and long-term consequences of febrile status epilepticus (FSE) in childhood.From 2003 to 2010, 199 children age 1 month to 5 years presenting with FSE (>30 minutes) were enrolled in FEBSTAT within 72 hours of the FSE episode. Of these, 191 had imaging with emphasis on the hippocampus. All MRIs were reviewed by 2 neuroradiologists blinded to clinical details. A group of 96 children with first simple FS who were imaged using a similar protocol served as controls.A total of 22 (11.5%) children had definitely abnormal (n = 17) or equivocal (n = 5) increased T2 signal in the hippocampus following FSE compared with none in the control group (p < 0.0001). Developmental abnormalities of the hippocampus were more common in the FSE group (n = 20, 10.5%) than in controls (n = 2, 2.1%) (p = 0.0097) with hippocampal malrotation being the most common (15 cases and 2 controls). Extrahippocampal imaging abnormalities were present in 15.7% of the FSE group and 15.6% of the controls. However, extrahippocampal imaging abnormalities of the temporal lobe were more common in the FSE group (7.9%) than in controls (1.0%) (p = 0.015).This prospective study demonstrates that children with FSE are at risk for acute hippocampal injury and that a substantial number also have abnormalities in hippocampal development. Follow-up studies are in progress to determine the long-term outcomes in these children.'

aS'Microwave tumor ablation is an attractive option for thermal ablation because of its inherent benefits over radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the treatment of solid tumors such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Microwave energy heats tissue to higher temperatures and at a faster rate than RFA, creating larger, more homogenous ablation zones. In this study, we investigate microwave heating near large vasculature using coupled fluid-flow and thermal analysis. Low-flow conditions are predicted to be more likely to cause cytotoxic heating and, therefore, vessel thrombosis and endothelial damage of downstream tissues. Such conditions may be more prevalent in patient with severe cirrhosis or compromised blood flow. High-flow conditions create the more familiar heat-sink effect that can protect perivascular tissues from the intended thermal damage. These results may help guide placement and use of microwave ablation technologies in future studies.'

aS'The distribution and co-morbidity of common psychiatric disorders can be largely explained as manifestations of two broad psychopathological spectra of internalizing and externalizing disorders. Twin studies suggest that these spectra arise from genetic factors.Structural equation twin modeling was applied to interview and questionnaire data on personality traits and lifetime psychiatric disorders on more than 5300 members of male-male (MM) and female-female (FF) twin pairs.The best-fitting models for both the externalizing and internalizing spectra differed significantly in males and females. In males, the externalizing genetic common factor was best indexed by four disorders in the following order: antisocial personality disorder (ASPD), drug abuse/dependence (DAD), alcohol abuse dependence (AAD) and conduct disorder (CD). In females, the four disorders most closely related to the externalizing common factor were, in order: DAD, AAD, nicotine dependence (ND) and ASPD. Personality traits of novelty seeking (NS) and extraversion (E) better indexed the genetic externalizing spectrum in females than in males. In both males and females, major depression (MD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) best indexed the genetic internalizing common factor. Panic disorder (PD) and agoraphobia (AgP) better reflected the internalizing genetic common factor in women, and neuroticism (N) in men. Genetic correlations between the two spectra were estimated at + 0.53 in males and + 0.52 in females.The disorders that optimally index the genetic liability to externalizing and internalizing disorders in the general population differ meaningfully in men and women. In both sexes, these genetic spectra are better assessed by psychiatric disorders than by personality traits.'

A subcohort (n=97) with available CT scans and serum biomarkers was identified. WTC-LI was defined as FEV1\xe2\x89\xa477% at the subspecialty pulmonary evaluation (n=34) and compared with controls (n=63) to determine the associated PA/A ratio. The subcohort was restratified based on PA/A\xe2\x89\xa50.92 (n=38) and PA/A<0.92(n=59) to determine serum vascular biomarkers that were predictive of this vasculopathy.The primary outcome of this study was to identify a PA/A ratio in a cohort of individuals exposed to WTC dust that was associated with WTC-LI. The secondary outcome was to identify serum biomarkers predictive of the PA/A ratio using logistic regression.PA/A\xe2\x89\xa50.92 was associated with WTC-LI, OR of 4.02 (95% CI 1.21 to 13.41; p=0.023) when adjusted for exposure, body mass index and age at CT. Elevated macrophage derived chemokine and soluble endothelial selectin were predictive of PA/A\xe2\x89\xa50.92, (OR, 95% CI 2.08, 1.05 to 4.11, p=0.036; 1.33, 1.06 to 1.68, p=0.016, respectively), while the increased total plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 was predictive of not having PA/A\xe2\x89\xa50.92 (OR 0.88, 0.79 to 0.98; p=0.024).Elevated PA/A was associated with WTC-LI. Development of an elevated PA/A was predicted by biomarkers of vascular disease found in serum drawn within 6\xe2\x80\x85months of WTC exposure. Increased PA/A is a potentially useful non-invasive biomarker of WTC-LI and warrants further study.'

aS'Cross-sectional studies demonstrate an association between metabolic syndrome and impaired lung function.To define if metabolic syndrome biomarkers are risk factors for loss of lung function after irritant exposure.A nested case-control study of Fire Department of New York personnel with normal pre-September 11th FEV(1) and who presented for subspecialty pulmonary evaluation before March 10, 2008. We correlated metabolic syndrome biomarkers obtained within 6 months of World Trade Center dust exposure with subsequent FEV(1). FEV(1) at subspecialty pulmonary evaluation within 6.5 years defined disease status; cases had FEV(1) less than lower limit of normal, whereas control subjects had FEV(1) greater than or equal to lower limit of normal.Clinical data and serum sampled at the first monitoring examination within 6 months of September 11, 2001, assessed body mass index, heart rate, serum glucose, triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein (HDL), leptin, pancreatic polypeptide, and amylin. Cases and control subjects had significant differences in HDL less than 40 mg/dl with triglycerides greater than or equal to 150 mg/dl, heart rate greater than or equal to 66 bpm, and leptin greater than or equal to 10,300 pg/ml. Each increased the odds of abnormal FEV(1) at pulmonary evaluation by more than twofold, whereas amylin greater than or equal to 116 pg/ml decreased the odds by 84%, in a multibiomarker model adjusting for age, race, body mass index, and World Trade Center arrival time. This model had a sensitivity of 41%, a specificity of 86%, and a receiver operating characteristic area under the curve of 0.77.Abnormal triglycerides and HDL and elevated heart rate and leptin are independent risk factors of greater susceptibility to lung function impairment after September 11, 2001, whereas elevated amylin is protective. Metabolic biomarkers are predictors of lung disease, and may be useful for assessing risk of impaired lung function in response to particulate inhalation.'

aS"After 9/11/2001, some Fire Department of New York (FDNY) workers had excessive lung function decline. We hypothesized that early serum matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) expression predicts World Trade Center-Lung Injury (WTC-LI) years later.This is a nested case-control analysis of never-smoking male firefighters with normal pre-exposure Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1) who had serum drawn up to 155 days post 9/11/2001. Serum MMP-1, 2,3,7,8, 9, 12 and 13 were measured. Cases of WTC-LI (N = 70) were defined as having an FEV1 one standard deviation below the mean (FEV1 \xe2\x89\xa4 77%) at subspecialty pulmonary evaluation (SPE) which was performed 32 months (IQR 21-53) post-9/11. Controls (N = 123) were randomly selected. We modeled MMP's ability as a predictor of cases status with logistic regression adjusted for time to blood draw, exposure intensity, weight gain and pre-9/11 FEV1.Each log-increase in MMP-3 and MMP-12 showed reduced odds of developing WTC-LI by 73% and 54% respectively. MMP-3 and MMP-12 consistently clustered together in cases, controls, and the cohort. Increasing time to blood draw significantly and independently increased the risk of WTC-LI.Elevated serum levels of MMP-3 and MMP-12 reduce the risk of developing WTC-LI. At any level of MMP-3 or 12, increased time to blood draw is associated with a diminished protective effect."

aS'Psoriasis is a common chronic inflammatory disease of the skin. We sought to use bacterial community abundance data to assess the feasibility of developing multivariate molecular signatures for differentiation of cutaneous psoriatic lesions, clinically unaffected contralateral skin from psoriatic patients, and similar cutaneous loci in matched healthy control subjects. Using 16S rRNA high-throughput DNA sequencing, we assayed the cutaneous microbiome for 51 such matched specimen triplets including subjects of both genders, different age groups, ethnicities and multiple body sites. None of the subjects had recently received relevant treatments or antibiotics. We found that molecular signatures for the diagnosis of psoriasis result in significant accuracy ranging from 0.75 to 0.89 AUC, depending on the classification task. We also found a significant effect of DNA sequencing and downstream analysis protocols on the accuracy of molecular signatures. Our results demonstrate that it is feasible to develop accurate molecular signatures for the diagnosis of psoriasis from microbiomic data.'

aS'The influence of autophagy inhibition on radiation sensitivity was studied in human breast, head and neck, and non-small cell lung cancer cell lines, in cell lines that were either wild type or mutant/null in p53, and in cells where p53 was inducible or silenced. Whereas ionizing radiation promoted autophagy in all tumor cell lines studied, pharmacological inhibition of autophagy and/or genetic silencing of autophagy genes failed to influence sensitivity to radiation in p53 mutant Hs578t breast tumor cells, HN6 head and neck tumor cells, and H358 non-small cell lung cancer cells. The requirement for functional p53 in the promotion of cytoprotective autophagy by radiation was confirmed by the observation that radiation-induced autophagy was nonprotective in p53 null H1299 cells but was converted to the cytoprotective form with induction of p53. Conversely, whereas p53 wild-type HN30 head and neck cancer cells did show sensitization to radiation upon autophagy inhibition, HN30 cells in which p53 was knocked down using small hairpin RNA failed to be sensitized by pharmacological autophagy inhibition. Taken together, these findings indicate that radiation-induced autophagy can be either cytoprotective or nonprotective, a functional difference related to the presence or absence of function p53. Alternatively, these findings could be interpreted to suggest that whereas radiation can induce autophagy independent of p53 status, inhibition of autophagy promotes enhanced radiation sensitivity through a mechanism that requires functional p53. These observations are likely to have direct implications with respect to clinical efforts to modulate the response of malignancies to radiation through autophagy inhibition.'

aS'During childhood and adolescence, physiological, psychological, and behavioral processes strongly promote weight gain and increased appetite while also inhibiting weight loss and decreased appetite. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV (DSM-IV) treats both weight-gain/increased-appetite and weight-loss/decreased-appetite as symptoms of major depression during these developmental periods, despite the fact that one complements typical development and the other opposes it. To disentangle the developmental versus pathological correlates of weight and appetite disturbance in younger age groups, the current study examined symptoms of depression in an aggregated sample of 2307 children and adolescents, 47.25% of whom met criteria for major depressive disorder. A multigroup, multidimensional item response theory model generated three key results. First, weight loss and decreased appetite loaded strongly onto a general depression dimension; in contrast, weight gain and increased appetite did not. Instead, weight gain and increased appetite loaded onto a separate dimension that did not correlate strongly with general depression. Second, inclusion or exclusion of weight gain and increased appetite affected neither the nature of the general depression dimension nor the fidelity of major depressive disorder diagnosis. Third, the general depression dimension and the weight-gain/increased-appetite dimension showed different patterns across age and gender. In child and adolescent populations, these results call into question the utility of weight gain and increased appetite as indicators of depression. This has serious implications for the diagnostic criteria of depression in children and adolescents. These findings inform a revision of the DSM, with implications for the diagnosis of depression in this age group and for research on depression.'

aS'Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with increased platelet activation and reduced platelet inhibition by clopidogrel. Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) stimulates adenyl cyclase activity in platelets and increases cyclic AMP concentrations, which inhibit Ca(2+)release and platelet aggregation induced by P2Y1 receptor activation. PGE1 is included in the VerifyNow P2Y12 assay to suppress P2Y1 induced platelet aggregation. We hypothesized that diabetes mellitus may be associated with altered response to PGE1 in subjects treated with clopidogrel. Subjects with established coronary artery disease who were taking clopidogrel 75\xe2\x80\x89mg daily and aspirin for >14 days were enrolled (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8996). Diabetic (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8934) were compared with non-diabetic subjects (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8962). VerifyNow P2Y12 assay and light transmittance aggregometry (LTA) were performed using ADP as agonist with and without addition of PGE1. Genomic DNA was genotyped for common cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 variants using Taqman assays. Residual on-treatment platelet aggregation induced by 20\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb5M ADP was not significantly different between subjects with and without DM. Addition of 22\xe2\x80\x89nM and 88\xe2\x80\x89nM PGE1 to 20\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb5M ADP resulted in a significant reduction of maximal platelet aggregation (MPA). Residual LTA platelet aggregation with PGE1 and VerifyNow P2Y12 platelet reactivity were significantly higher in subjects with DM than those without DM and in carriers of CYP 2C19*2 polymorphism. We conclude that an impaired inhibitory response to PGE1 may contribute to the high platelet reactivity phenotype in subjects with DM treated with clopidogrel. Addition of PGE1 to ADP agonist platelet assays may identify subjects with blunted inhibitory response to prostaglandins and result in a higher proportion of subjects with DM being classified as non-responders.'

aS"The ability to recognize familiar people is impaired in both Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's Dementia (AD). In addition, both groups often demonstrate a time-limited temporal gradient (TG) in which well known people from decades earlier are better recalled than those learned recently. In this study, we examined the TG in cognitively intact elders for remote famous names (1950-1965) compared to more recent famous names (1995-2005). We hypothesized that the TG pattern on a famous name recognition task (FNRT) would predict future cognitive decline, and also show a significant correlation with hippocampal volume.Seventy-eight healthy elders (ages 65-90) with age-appropriate cognitive functioning at baseline were administered a FNRT. Follow-up testing 18 months later produced two groups: Declining (\xe2\x89\xa5 1 SD reduction on at least one of three measures) and Stable (< 1 SD).The Declining group (N = 27) recognized fewer recent famous names than the Stable group (N = 51), although recognition for remote names was comparable. Baseline MRI volumes for both the left and right hippocampi were significantly smaller in the Declining group than the Stable group. Smaller baseline hippocampal volume was also significantly correlated with poorer performance for recent, but not remote famous names. Logistic regression analyses indicated that baseline TG performance was a significant predictor of group status (Declining vs. Stable) independent of chronological age and APOE \xce\xb54 inheritance.The TG for famous name recognition may serve as an early preclinical cognitive marker of cognitive decline in healthy older individuals."

aS"Early onset of regular smoking is associated with an elevated risk for later nicotine dependence. Whether or not this association is causal is unknown and has substantial public policy implications.The authors used a monozygotic co-twin control study design. Pairs were selected from the Virginia Adult Twin Study of Psychiatric and Substance Use Disorders for discordance in age at onset of regular smoking. Nicotine dependence was measured by the Fagerstr\xc3\xb6m test for nicotine dependence and level of craving.The authors identified 175 male-male and 69 female-female monozygotic twin pairs who differed by at least 2 years in age at onset of regular smoking. During their period of heaviest smoking, the twin who began smoking earlier had significantly higher Fagerstr\xc3\xb6m test scores in both the male-male (Cohen's d=0.20) and female-female twin pairs (d=0.26). Craving for cigarettes when unable to smoke was also higher in the early-onset member in both groups (male pairs, d=0.38; female pairs, d=0.25). The early-onset smoking twin did not differ from the later-onset twin in symptoms of alcohol or cannabis abuse or dependence, current alcohol use, or maximal level of cannabis, sedative, stimulant, or cocaine use.Controlling for genetic and familial-environmental effects, age at onset of regular smoking predicted level of nicotine dependence. Consistent with the animal literature, these findings suggest that in humans, early nicotine exposure directly increases level of later nicotine dependence. These results should be interpreted in the context of the methodological strengths and limitations of the monozygotic co-twin design."

aS'The objective of the study was to quantitatively characterize peripheral tissue microvascular oxygenation during emergency department (ED) treatment of acute heart failure (HF).This prospective, observational study enrolled acutely decompensated HF patients presenting to an urban ED and stable, asymptomatic HF patients evaluated in an outpatient cardiology clinic. Stable, pre-ED treatment, and post-ED treatment microvascular oxygen extraction ratios (OER(M)s) were calculated, defined as SaO(2) - StO(2)/0.8*SaO(2), where SaO(2) is pulse oximetry-derived arterial hemoglobin saturation and StO(2) is the tissue hemoglobin oxygen saturation measured with differential absorption spectroscopy. The OER(M) measurements were analyzed using repeated-measures analysis of variance. Pulse oximetry, patient demographics, HF etiology, serum B-type natriuretic peptide, and hemoglobin were measured along with a visual analogue scale to assess patient baseline characteristics and response to ED treatment (P < .05 was considered significant for all testing).The OER(M) for the stable HF group (n = 45) was 0.65 (SE = 0.07). The pre- and posttreatment OER(M)s for the ED HF group (n = 46) were 0.92 (SE = 0.07) and 0.75 (SE = 0.06), respectively. Whereas the pretreatment ED OER(M) was higher than the stable patient OER(M) (P = .001), the posttreatment ED OER(M) was not significantly different from the stable patient measurement (P = .271).Oxygen extraction in acute HF is significantly increased, but approaches values found in the stable HF population after ED treatment. The OER(M) may deserve closer examination as a possible goal-directed variable in the treatment of acute HF.'

aS'The purpose of this study was to quantify hip and ankle impairments contributing to movement dysfunction in multiple sclerosis (MS).Volitional phasing of bilateral hip and ankle torques was assessed using a load-cell-instrumented servomotor drive system in ten participants with MS and 10 age-matched healthy participants. The hips and ankles were separately bilaterally oscillated 180\xc2\xb0 out of phase (40\xc2\xb0 range of motion) at a frequency of 0.75 Hz while the other joints were held stationary. Participants were instructed to assist in the same direction as the robot-imposed movement. The hip and ankle torques were measured and work was calculated for each movement.Total negative work at the ankle was significantly different between groups (p=0.040). The participants with MS produced larger negative work during hip flexion (p=0.042) and ankle flexion (p=0.037). Negative work at the hip was significantly correlated with the Berg Balance Scores and Timed 25 Feet Walk Test, and trends demonstrated increasing negative work with increasing clinical impairment in MS.These results suggest an increased importance of the hip in functional balance and gait in MS.Rehabilitation strategies targeting ankle recovery or compensation using the hip might improve movement function in MS.'

aS'Many stroke survivors suffer from impaired hand function. Biomechanics of hand grip suggests that abnormally directed grip force can hamper gripping abilities and hand function. This study examined the relation between the ability to precisely direct fingertip force and clinical hand function scores among individuals affected by stroke. Specifically, clinical hand function tests of the Fugl-Meyer, Chedoke McMaster, and Box and Block Test were used, since they involve various hand movements required for activities of daily living. Digit force direction during static grip was recorded using multiaxial load cells. Data for 59 chronic stroke survivors were analyzed. We found that larger angular deviation of digit force from the normal direction was significantly associated with lower hand functional levels (p<.001 for all three clinical tests). Particularly, stroke survivors whose digit force deviated more than 21\xc2\xb0 from the normal direction could not achieve the normal level of Fugl-Meyer or Chedoke or move more than 4 blocks in a minute. The biomechanics of the way digit force direction affects hand grip function is described. In addition, underlying mechanisms for altered digit force direction post stroke are postulated, including impaired somatosensation and abnormal neural input to muscles. In summary, this study identifies a new biomechanical marker for hand functional level and recovery. Future interventions may focus on correcting digit force direction to improve hand functional outcome.'

SDB events manually scored from the airflow as apnea (airflow reduction > 90%), hypopnea (airflow reduction > 30% lasting 10 to 120 sec with inspira-tory flow limitation [IFL]) and runs of sustained IFL > 2 min identified. RDI = (apnea + hypopnea)/total sleep time calculated for each night and an obstruction index, including sustained IFL, also was calculated. PressureMultinight was obtained for each patient from multiple nights of data using two mathematical techniques. Night-to-night variability of SDB indices was low in some patients and significant in others. PressureMultinight could be determined in 17 of 28 patients and was similar to the in-laboratory pressure.This study showed that recording multiple nights of CPAP airflow in the home and analyzing these data for residual SDB provided useful information, including the possibility of determining a therapeutic prescription for fixed CPAP in most patients and identification of others with significant physiologic variability of SDB.'

aS"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is associated with early memory loss, Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology, inefficient or ineffective neural processing, and increased risk for AD. Unfortunately, treatments aimed at improving clinical symptoms or markers of brain function generally have been of limited value. Physical exercise is often recommended for people diagnosed with MCI, primarily because of its widely reported cognitive benefits in healthy older adults. However, it is unknown if exercise actually benefits brain function during memory retrieval in MCI. Here, we examined the effects of exercise training on semantic memory activation during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Seventeen MCI participants and 18 cognitively intact controls, similar in sex, age, education, genetic risk, and medication use, volunteered for a 12-week exercise intervention consisting of supervised treadmill walking at a moderate intensity. Both MCI and control participants significantly increased their cardiorespiratory fitness by approximately 10% on a treadmill exercise test. Before and after the exercise intervention, participants completed an fMRI famous name discrimination task and a neuropsychological battery, Performance on Trial 1 of a list-learning task significantly improved in the MCI participants. Eleven brain regions activated during the semantic memory task showed a significant decrease in activation intensity following the intervention that was similar between groups (p-values ranged 0.048 to 0.0001). These findings suggest exercise may improve neural efficiency during semantic memory retrieval in MCI and cognitively intact older adults, and may lead to improvement in cognitive function. Clinical trials are needed to determine if exercise is effective to delay conversion to AD."

aS'Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited chronic disease that is characterized by complications such as recurrent painful vaso-occlusive events that require frequent hospitalizations and contribute to early mortality. The objective of the study was to report on the initial measurement properties of the new PedsQL\xe2\x84\xa2 SCD Module for pediatric patient self-report ages 5-18 years and parent proxy-report for ages 2-18 years.The 43-item PedsQL\xe2\x84\xa2 SCD Module was completed in a multisite study by 243 pediatric patients with SCD and 313 parents. Participants also completed the PedsQL\xe2\x84\xa2 4.0 Generic Core Scales and PedsQL\xe2\x84\xa2 Multidimensional Fatigue Scale.The PedsQL\xe2\x84\xa2 SCD Module Scales evidenced excellent feasibility, excellent reliability for the Total Scale Scores (patient self-report \xce\xb1 = 0.95; parent proxy-report \xce\xb1 = 0.97), and good reliability for the nine individual scales (patient self-report \xce\xb1 = 0.69-0.90; parent proxy-report \xce\xb1 = 0.83-0.97). Intercorrelations with the PedsQL\xe2\x84\xa2 Generic Core Scales and PedsQL\xe2\x84\xa2 Multidimensional Fatigue Scales were medium (0.30) to large (0.50) range, supporting construct validity. PedsQL\xe2\x84\xa2 SCD Module Scale Scores were generally worse for patients with severe versus mild disease. Confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated an acceptable to excellent model fit.The PedsQL\xe2\x84\xa2 SCD Module demonstrated acceptable measurement properties.

aS'A blood pump specifically designed to augment flow from the great veins through the lungs would ameliorate the poor physiology of the failing univentricular circulation and result in a paradigm shift in the treatment strategy for Fontan patients. This study is the first to examine mechanical cavopulmonary assistance with a blood pump in the inferior vena cava (IVC) and hepatic blood flow. Five numerical models of mechanical cavopulmonary assistance were investigated using a three-dimensional, reconstructed, patient-specific Fontan circulation from magnetic resonance imaging data. Pressure flow characteristics of the axial blood pump, energy augmentation calculations for the cavopulmonary circulation with and without pump support, and hemolysis estimations were determined. In all of the pump-supported scenarios, a pressure increase of 7-9.5 mm Hg was achieved. The fluid power of the cavopulmonary circulation was also positive over the range of flow rates. No retrograde flow from the IVC into the hepatic circulation was evident during support cases. Vessel suction risk, however, was found for greater operating rotational speeds. Fluid shear stresses and hemolysis predictions remained at acceptable levels with normalized index of hemolysis estimations at 0.0001 g/100 L. The findings of this study support the continued design and development of this blood pump technology for Fontan patients with progressive cardiovascular insufficiency. Validation of these flow and performance predictions will be completed in the next round of experimental testing with blood bag evaluation.'

This open-label study assessed the impact on clinical hemostasis of human antibodies to bovine thrombin (aBT) or factor V/Va (aBV/Va) in response to topical bovine thrombin (THROMBIN-JMI) in patients both with and without preexisting anti-bovine antibodies. Noninferiority analysis assessed primary endpoint for mean shift from baseline activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) at 48 hours postsurgery; secondary endpoints included changes from baseline antibodies/titers and coagulation parameters through 8 weeks postsurgery. A total of 550 patients underwent surgery with THROMBIN-JMI utilized at investigator's discretion. Adjusted mean aPTT change in (+)aBT/(+)THROMBIN-JMI cohort was greater than (-)aBT/(-)THROMBIN-JMI cohort; 4.67-second upper confidence bound exceeded 4.5-second margin (based on assumed mean aPTT of 30 seconds) and noninferiority was not met. Post hoc analysis indicated noninferiority would have been met had noninferiority margin been set prior at relative 15% of actual baseline aPTT. Antibodies/titers were unchanged by THROMBIN-JMI exposure 48 hours postsurgery and unrelated to postsurgical changes in coagulation. Thus, THROMBIN-JMI exposure in patients with/without preexisting aBT or aBV/Va does not alter hemostasis."

aS"A brain-computer interface (BCI) is a communication system that takes recorded brain signals and translates them into real-time actions, in this case movement of a cursor on a computer screen. This work applied Fitts' law to the evaluation of performance on a target acquisition task during sensorimotor rhythm-based BCI training. Fitts' law, which has been used as a predictor of movement time in studies of human movement, was used here to determine the information transfer rate, which was based on target acquisition time and target difficulty. The information transfer rate was used to make comparisons between control modalities and subject groups on the same task. Data were analyzed from eight able-bodied and five motor disabled participants who wore an electrode cap that recorded and translated their electroencephalogram (EEG) signals into computer cursor movements. Direct comparisons were made between able-bodied and disabled subjects, and between EEG and joystick cursor control in able-bodied subjects. Fitts' law aptly described the relationship between movement time and index of difficulty for each task movement direction when evaluated separately and averaged together. This study showed that Fitts' law can be successfully applied to computer cursor movement controlled by neural signals."

aS'Oxalobacter formigenes (OF) may play a protective role in preventing calcium oxalate stones. This is the first prospective study to evaluate the effect of antibiotics on OF colonization. Intestinal colonization by OF is associated with reduced urinary oxalate excretion. Exposure to antibiotics may be an important factor determining rates of colonization.The effect of antibiotics on OF colonization was compared in two groups: A group receiving antibiotics for gastric infection with Helicobacter pylori (HP) and a group without HP whose members were not receiving antibiotics. OF colonization in stool was detected by oxalate degradation at baseline and after 1 and 6 months.The prevalence at baseline of intestinal colonization with OF was 43.1% among all patients screened. Among the 12 patients who were positive for OF who did not receive antibiotics, 11 (92%) had OF on stool tests at 1 month and 6 months. Of the 19 participants who were positive for OF and who received antibiotics for HP, only 7 (36.8%) continued to be colonized by OF on follow-up stool testing at 1 and 6 months (P=0.003 by Fisher exact test). Amoxicillin and clarithromycin caused 62.5% of subjects to become negative for OF at 1 month; 56.2% remained negative for OF at 6 months.Antibiotics for HP infection effectively reduced colonization with OF, an effect present at 1 and 6 months after treatment. The lasting elimination of OF could be associated with hyperoxaluria and be a factor in recurrent kidney stone disease.'

aS'Randomized, double-blind, parallel-group clinical trial.To assess differences between a progressive agility and trunk stabilization rehabilitation program and a progressive running and eccentric strengthening rehabilitation program in recovery characteristics following an acute hamstring injury, as measured via physical examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).Determining the type of rehabilitation program that most effectively promotes muscle and functional recovery is essential to minimize reinjury risk and to optimize athlete performance.Individuals who sustained a recent hamstring strain injury were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 rehabilitation programs: (1) progressive agility and trunk stabilization or (2) progressive running and eccentric strengthening. MRI and physical examinations were conducted before and after completion of rehabilitation.Thirty-one subjects were enrolled, 29 began rehabilitation, and 25 completed rehabilitation. There were few differences in clinical or morphological outcome measures between rehabilitation groups across time, and reinjury rates were low for both rehabilitation groups after return to sport (4 of 29 subjects had reinjuries). Greater craniocaudal length of injury, as measured on MRI before the start of rehabilitation, was positively correlated with longer return-to-sport time. At the time of return to sport, although all subjects showed a near-complete resolution of pain and return of muscle strength, no subject showed complete resolution of injury as assessed on MRI.The 2 rehabilitation programs employed in this study yielded similar results with respect to hamstring muscle recovery and function at the time of return to sport. Evidence of continuing muscular healing is present after completion of rehabilitation, despite the appearance of normal physical strength and function on clinical examination.Therapy, level 1b-.'

Research in understanding the pathogenetic mechanisms of neurofibroma development has led to the use of new clinical trials for the treatment of NF1. One of the most important outcomes of a trial is improvement in quality of life, however, no condition specific HRQOL instrument for NF1 exists. The objective of this study was to develop an NF1 HRQOL instrument as a module of PedsQL\xe2\x84\xa2 and to test for its initial feasibility, internal consistency reliability and validity in adults with NF1.The NF1 specific HRQOL instrument was developed using a standard method of PedsQL\xe2\x84\xa2 module development - literature review, focus group/semi-structured interviews, cognitive interviews and experts' review of initial draft, pilot testing and field testing. Field testing involved 134 adults with NF1. Feasibility was measured by the percentage of missing responses, internal consistency reliability was measured with Cronbach's alpha and validity was measured by the known-groups method.Feasibility, measured by the percentage of missing responses was 4.8% for all subscales on the adult version of the NF1-specific instrument. Internal consistency reliability for the Total Score (alpha =0.97) and subscale reliabilities ranging from 0.72 to 0.96 were acceptable for group comparisons. The PedsQL\xe2\x84\xa2 NF1 module distinguished between NF1 adults with excellent to very good, good, and fair to poor health status.The results demonstrate the initial feasibility, reliability and validity of the PedsQL\xe2\x84\xa2 NF1 module in adult patients.

aS'Safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of recombinant von Willebrand factor (rVWF) combined at a fixed ratio with recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) were investigated in 32 subjects with type 3 or severe type 1 von Willebrand disease (VWD) in a prospective phase 1, multicenter, randomized clinical trial. rVWF was well tolerated and no thrombotic events, inhibitors, or serious adverse events were observed. The PK of rVWF ristocetin cofactor activity, VWF antigen, and collagen-binding activity were similar to those of the comparator plasma-derived (pd) VWF-pdFVIII. In vivo cleavage of ultra-large molecular-weight rVWF multimers by ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13; the endogenous VWF protease) and generation of characteristic satellite bands were demonstrated. In 2 subjects with specific nonneutralizing anti-VWF-binding antibodies already detectable before rVWF infusion, a reduction in VWF multimers and VWF activity was observed. Stabilization of endogenous FVIII was enhanced following post-rVWF-rFVIII infusion as shown by the difference in area under the plasma concentration curve compared with pdVWF-pdFVIII (AUC0-\xe2\x88\x9e) (P < .01). These data support the concept of administering rVWF alone once a therapeutic level of endogenous FVIII is achieved.'

aS'Obesity precedes and is strongly linked to the development of type 2 diabetic nephropathy in most patients, yet little is known about the effects of weight reduction on this disease. This study aimed to establish proof of concept for the hypothesis that weight reduction ameliorates diabetic nephropathy.Six obese individuals with advanced diabetic nephropathy (estimated GFR <40 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), urine albumin excretion >30 mg/d) currently taking a renin-aldosterone axis inhibitor underwent a 12-week very low calorie ketogenic weight reduction diet with encouragement of exercise between March and September 2012. Albuminuria and other parameters of kidney health were the main outcome measures.There was a 12% reduction in weight (median 118.5 versus 104.3 kg, P=0.03). The intervention was associated with a 36% reduction in albuminuria that did not reach statistical significance (2124 versus 1366 mg/24 h, P=0.08) and significant reductions in the filtration markers serum creatinine (3.54 versus 3.13 mg/dl, P<0.05) and cystatin C (2.79 versus 2.46 mg/l, P<0.05). Improvements were also noted for the diabetes markers fasting glucose (166 versus 131 mg/dl, P<0.05), fasting insulin (26.9 versus 10.4 \xce\xbcU/ml, P<0.05), and insulin resistance (9.6 versus 4.2, P=0.03). Physical function, general health, and the number of diabetes medications also showed statistically significant signs of improvement.After a short-term intensive weight reduction intervention in patients with advanced diabetic nephropathy, improvements were observed in markers of glomerular filtration, diabetes status, and risk factors for kidney disease progression, as well as other general indicators of health and well-being.'

aS'Recent observational studies have suggested that the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors is associated with an increased fracture risk and an accelerated bone loss, although conflicting results have been reported. Furthermore, because many of these studies have been performed in depressed women, confounding by indication may influence these findings.The objective of the study was to determine whether selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors affect bone metabolism Design: This was a randomized controlled trial.The study was conducted in four US clinical sites.Healthy peri- and postmenopausal women participated in the study.The intervention was escitalopram (10-20 mg/d) for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms.Serum carboxyterminal collagen crosslinks (CTX) and serum amino-terminal propeptide of type I collagen (P1NP) were measured.One hundred forty-one peri- or postmenopausal nondepressed women (mean age 53.7 y, SD 4.1) had baseline and 8-week follow-up samples available for analysis and were included in the study (69 escitalopram, 72 placebo). The groups were balanced across a broad range of baseline characteristics, including age, race, body mass index, smoking status, and mood symptoms. The between-group differences in the change in CTX and P1NP from baseline to week 8 were compared by a repeated-measures linear regression model adjusted for race, clinical center, and baseline measurement. Treatment with escitalopram reduced serum P1NP by 1.02 ng/mL on average [95% confidence interval (CI) -5.17, 3.12] compared with a reduction of 1.88 ng/mL (95% CI -4.82, 1.06) in the placebo group (P = .65). Similarly, serum CTX decreased 0.02 ng/mL on average (95% CI -0.05, 0.01) in the escitalopram group compared with 0.00 ng/mL (95% CI -0.02, 0.02) in the placebo group (P = .24). The results were similar when the analysis was restricted to those women whose adherence to study medication was 70% or greater.Although the study was limited to 8 weeks, these results suggest that escitalopram does not significantly alter bone metabolism in the short term.'

aS'To improve future drug development efficiency in renal cell carcinoma (RCC), a disease-progression model was developed with longitudinal tumor size data from a phase III trial of sorafenib in RCC. The best-fit model was externally evaluated on 145 placebo-treated patients in a phase III trial of pazopanib; the model incorporated baseline tumor size, a linear disease-progression component, and an exponential drug effect (DE) parameter. With the model-estimated effect of sorafenib on RCC growth, we calculated the power of randomized phase II trials between sorafenib and hypothetical comparators over a range of effects. A hypothetical comparator with 80% greater DE than sorafenib would have 82% power (one-sided \xce\xb1 = 0.1) with 50 patients per arm. Model-based quantitation of treatment effect with computed tomography (CT) imaging offers a scaffold on which to develop new, more efficient, phase II trial end points and analytic strategies for RCC.'

aS"Gulf War Illness (GWI) affects 1 in 7 returned Persian Gulf War veterans. Quality-of-life impact is large; there is no cure. Chronic sinus symptoms and fatigue are common. Nasal irrigation with saline (NI-S) or xylitol (NI-X) improve sinus symptoms and fatigue in the general population. This trial will assess the effect of NI-S and NI-X on sinus and fatigue symptoms, economic outcomes and pro-inflammatory milieu among participants with GWI.75 participants (age 35 to 65 years, 25 in each of three arms) with GWI will be recruited from the Veteran's Administration and the community. They will use routine care for sinus symptoms and fatigue and be randomized to continued usual care alone or additional therapy with NI-S or NI-X. Participants will be able to adjust specific elements of the NI procedure. The primary outcome (Sinonasal Outcome Test, SNOT-20) and other self-reported assessments will occur at baseline, 8 and 26 weeks; lab assessment of pro-inflammatory cellular and cytokine profiles will occur at baseline and 26 weeks. Other outcomes will include fatigue-specific and overall health-related quality of life, pro-inflammatory cellular and cytokine profiles, cost-effectiveness and participant satisfaction.Baseline demographic and clinical data from the first 10 participants show effective participant recruitment, enrollment, randomization, retention and data collection.Early study conduct suggests that our participant-oriented approach will yield high rates of participant adherence and data capture, facilitating robust analysis. Results of this study will clarify the value of NI for chronic sinus symptoms and fatigue among patients with GWI.clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01700725."

aS'The aim of this study was to evaluate HbA(1c) as an alternative criterion for impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or type 1 diabetes (T1D) in high-risk subjects <21 years of age.Subjects <21 years of age who participated in the prospective DPT-1, TEDDY, TRIGR, and Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet Natural History (TrialNet) studies and had an HbA(1c) within 90 days of an OGTT with a 2-h plasma glucose (2-hPG) measure were included. An OGTT of 140-199 mg/dL defined IGT, and an OGTT with 2-hPG \xe2\x89\xa5200 mg/dL or fasting plasma glucose \xe2\x89\xa5126 mg/dL defined diabetes. HbA(1c) \xe2\x89\xa55.7% defined IGT, and HbA(1c) \xe2\x89\xa5 6.5% defined diabetes. Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis was used to assess diagnostic accuracy of HbA(1c) compared with OGTT.There were 587 subjects from DPT-1, 884 from TrialNet, 91 from TEDDY, and 420 from TRIGR. As an indicator for IGT, HbA(1c) sensitivity was very low across the studies (8-42%), and specificity was variable (64-95%). With HbA(1c) \xe2\x89\xa56.5% threshold used for T1D diagnosis, the sensitivity was very low and specificity was high (sensitivity and specificity: DPT-1 24 and 98%, TrialNet 28 and 99%, TEDDY 34 and 98%, and TRIGR 33 and 99%, respectively). The positive predictive value of HbA(1c) \xe2\x89\xa56.5% for the development of T1D was variable (50-94%) across the four studies.HbA(1c) \xe2\x89\xa56.5% is a specific but not sensitive early indicator for T1D in high-risk subjects <21 years of age diagnosed by OGTT or asymptomatic hyperglycemia. Redefining the HbA(1c) threshold is recommended if used as an alternative criterion in diagnosing T1D.'

aS'This study aims to determine the efficacy of exercise training for alleviating vasomotor and other menopausal symptoms.Late perimenopausal and postmenopausal sedentary women with frequent vasomotor symptoms (VMS) participated in a randomized controlled trial conducted in three sites: 106 women randomized to exercise and 142 women randomized to usual activity. The exercise intervention consisted of individual facility-based aerobic exercise training three times per week for 12 weeks. VMS frequency and bother were recorded on daily diaries at baseline and on weeks 6 and 12. Intent-to-treat analyses compared between-group differences in changes in VMS frequency and bother, sleep symptoms (Insomnia Severity Index and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), and mood (Patient Health Questionnaire-8 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 questionnaire).At the end of week 12, changes in VMS frequency in the exercise group (mean change, -2.4 VMS/d; 95% CI, -3.0 to -1.7) and VMS bother (mean change on a four-point scale, -0.5; 95% CI, -0.6 to -0.4) were not significantly different from those in the control group (-2.6 VMS/d; 95% CI, -3.2 to -2.0; P = 0.43; -0.5 points; 95% CI, -0.6 to -0.4; P = 0.75). The exercise group reported greater improvement in insomnia symptoms (P = 0.03), subjective sleep quality (P = 0.01), and depressive symptoms (P = 0.04), but differences were small and not statistically significant when P values were adjusted for multiple comparisons. Results were similar when considering treatment-adherent women only.These findings provide strong evidence that 12 weeks of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise do not alleviate VMS but may result in small improvements in sleep quality, insomnia, and depression in midlife sedentary women.'

aS"This study aims to determine the efficacy and tolerability of omega-3 fatty acids in reducing vasomotor symptoms (VMS) frequency and bother in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.This study was a 12-week, three-by-two factorial, randomized controlled trial. Eligible women were randomized to a double-blind comparison of omega-3 (n = 177) or placebo (n = 178) capsules, and simultaneously to yoga (n = 107), aerobic exercise (n = 106), or their usual physical activity (n = 142). Participants received 1.8 g of omega-3 daily for 12 weeks. Each capsule contained ethyl eicosapentaenoic acid (425 mg), docosahexaenoic acid (100 mg), and other omega-3s (90 mg). Primary outcomes were VMS frequency and bother. Secondary outcomes included sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), insomnia symptoms (Insomnia Severity Index), depressive symptoms (Physician's Health Questionnaire-8), and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7).The mean baseline frequency of VMS per day was 7.6 (95% CI, 7.0 to 8.2). After 12 weeks, the reduction in VMS frequency with omega-3 (-2.5; 95% CI, -3.0 to -1.9) did not differ significantly from that with placebo (-2.7; 95% CI, -3.3 to -2.2), with a relative difference of 0.3 fewer hot flashes per day (95% CI, -0.5 to 1.0; P = 0.28). Changes in VMS bother at 12 weeks were also similar between groups, with no relative difference on a four-point scale (95% CI, -0.1 to 0.2; P = 0.36). Omega-3s compared with placebo showed no improvement in self-reported sleep or mood (P > 0.09 for all comparisons).Among healthy, sedentary perimenopausal and postmenopausal women, a 12-week treatment with omega-3 does not improve VMS frequency, VMS bother, sleep, or mood compared with placebo."

aS'Phase III noninferiority trial examining efficacy and safety of converting stable renal transplant recipients from twice-daily tacrolimus to a novel extended-release once-daily tacrolimus formulation (LCPT) with a controlled agglomeration technology. Controls maintained tacrolimus twice daily. The primary efficacy endpoint was proportion of patients with efficacy failures (death, graft failure, locally read biopsy-proven acute rejection [BPAR], or loss to follow-up) within 12 months. Starting LCPT dose was 30% lower (15% for blacks) than preconversion tacrolimus dose; target trough levels were 4-15 ng/mL. A total of 326 patients were randomized; the mITT population (n = 162 each group) was similar demographically in the two groups. Mean daily dose of LCPT was significantly (p < 0.0001) lower than preconversion tacrolimus dose at each visit; mean trough levels between groups were similar. There were four efficacy failures in each group; safety outcomes were similar between groups. Frequency of premature study drug discontinuation was LCPT: 12% versus tacrolimus twice daily: 5% (p = 0.028). LCPT demonstrated noninferiority to tacrolimus twice daily in efficacy failure rates. LCPT may offer a safe and effective alternative for converting patients to a once-daily formulation. Compared to currently available tacrolimus formulation, LCPT requires lower doses to achieve target trough levels.'

aS'A recent out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) clinical trial showed improved survival to hospital discharge (HD) with favorable neurologic function for patients with cardiac arrest of cardiac origin treated with active compression decompression cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) plus an impedance threshold device (ACD+ICD) versus standard (S) CPR. The current analysis examined whether treatment with ACD+ITD is more effective than standard (S-CPR) for all cardiac arrests of non-traumatic origin, regardless of the etiology.This is a secondary analysis of data from a randomized, prospective, multicenter, intention-to-treat, OHCA clinical trial. Adults with presumed non-traumatic cardiac arrest were enrolled and followed for one year post arrest. The primary endpoint was survival to hospital discharge (HD) with favorable neurologic function (Modified Rankin Scale score \xe2\x89\xa4 3).Between October 2005 and July 2009, 2738 patients were enrolled (S-CPR=1335; ACD+ITD=1403). Survival to HD with favorable neurologic function was greater with ACD+ITD compared with S-CPR: 7.9% versus 5.7%, (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.04, 1.95, p=0.027). One-year survival was also greater: 7.9% versus 5.7%, (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.04, 1.96, p=0.026). Nearly all survivors in both groups had returned to their baseline neurological function by one year. Major adverse event rates were similar between groups.Treatment of out-of-hospital non-traumatic cardiac arrest patients with ACD+ITD resulted in a significant increase in survival to hospital discharge with favorable neurological function when compared with S-CPR. A significant increase survival rates was observed up to one year after arrest in subjects treated with ACD+ITD, regardless of the etiology of the cardiac arrest.'

aS'To reduce pediatric obesity in clinical settings, multidisciplinary behaviorally-based treatment programs are recommended. High attrition and poor compliance are two difficulties frequently encountered in such programs. A brief, empathic and directive clinical intervention, Motivational Interviewing (MI), might help address these motivational and behavioral issues, ultimately resulting in more positive health outcomes. The efficacy of MI as an adjunct in the treatment of pediatric obesity remains relatively understudied. MI Values was developed to implement within an existing multidisciplinary treatment program for obese, ethnically diverse adolescents, the T.E.E.N.S. Program (Teaching, Encouragement, Exercise, Nutrition, Support). T.E.E.N.S. participants who consent to MI Values are randomized to either MI or an education control condition. At weeks 1 and 10 of T.E.E.N.S. participation, the subset of participants assigned to the MI condition engages in individual MI sessions and control participants view health education videos. All MI sessions are audiotaped and coded to monitor treatment fidelity, which has been satisfactory thus far. Participants complete comprehensive assessments at baseline, 3- and 6-month follow-ups. We hypothesize that MI participants will demonstrate greater reductions in Body Mass Index (BMI) percentile, improved diet and physical activity behaviors, better compliance with T.E.E.N.S., and lower attrition than participants in the control group. We present study design and methods for MI Values as well as data on feasibility of recruitment methods and treatment integrity. At study completion, findings will contribute to the emerging literature examining the efficacy of MI in the treatment of pediatric obesity.'

aS'The objective of this study was to assess change in sitting and physical activity behavior in response to a workplace intervention to disrupt prolonged sitting time.Sixty office workers were randomized to either a Stand group (n = 29), which received hourly prompts (computer-based and wrist-worn) to stand up, or a Step group (n = 31), which received the same hourly prompts and an additional prompt to walk 100 steps or more upon standing. An ActivPAL monitor was used to assess sitting and physical activity behavior on the same 3 consecutive workdays during baseline and intervention periods. Mixed-effect models with random intercepts and random slopes for time were performed to assess change between groups and across time.Both groups significantly reduced duration of average sitting bouts (Stand group, by 16%; Step group, by 19%) and the number of sitting bouts of 60 minutes or more (Step group, by 36%; Stand group, by 54%). The Stand group significantly reduced total sitting time (by 6.6%), duration of the longest sitting bout (by 29%), and number of sitting bouts of 30 minutes or more (by 13%) and increased the number of sit-to-stand transitions (by 15%) and standing time (by 23%). Stepping time significantly increased in the Stand (by 14%) and Step (by 29%) groups, but only the Step group significantly increased (by 35%) the number of steps per workday. Differences in changes from baseline to intervention between groups were not significant for any outcome.Interventions that focus on disrupting sitting time only in the workplace may result in less sitting. When sitting time disruptions are paired with a physical activity prompt, people may be more likely to increase their workday physical activity, but the effect on sitting time may be attenuated.'

aS'Low platelet count is a marker of portal hypertension but is not routinely included in the standard preoperative evaluation of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) because it pertains to liver function (Child/model for end-stage liver disease [MELD] score) and tumor burden (Milan criteria). We hypothesized that low platelet count would be independently associated with increased perioperative morbidity and mortality after resection.Patients treated with liver resection for HCC between January 2000 and January 2010 at 3 institutions were eligible. Preoperative platelet count, Child/MELD score, and tumor extent were recorded. Low preoperative platelet count (LPPC) was defined as <150 \xc3\x97 10(3)/\xce\xbcL. Postoperative liver insufficiency (PLI) was defined as peak bilirubin >7 mg/dL or development of ascites. Univariate and multivariate regression was performed for predictors of major complications, PLI, and 60-day mortality.A total of 231 patients underwent resection, of whom 196 (85%) were classified as Child A and 35 (15%) as Child B; median MELD score was 8. Overall, 168 (71%) had tumors that exceeded Milan criteria and 134 (58%) had major hepatectomy (\xe2\x89\xa53 Couinaud segments). Overall and major complication rates were 55% and 17%, respectively. PLI occurred in 25 patients (11%), and 21 (9%) died within 60 days of surgery. Patients with LPPC (n = 50) had a significantly increased number of major complications (28% versus 14%, p = 0.031), PLI (30% versus 6%, p = 0.001), and 60-day mortality (22% versus 6%, p = 0.001). When adjusted for Child/MELD score and tumor burden, LPPC remained independently associated with increased number of major complications (odds ratio [OR] 2.8, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.1 to 6.8, p = 0.026), PLI (OR 4.0, 95% CI 1.4 to 11.1, p = 0.008), and 60-day mortality (OR 4.6, 95% CI 1.5 to 14.6, p = 0.009).LPPC is independently associated with increased major complications, PLI, and mortality after resection of HCC, even when accounting for standard criteria, such as Child/MELD score and tumor extent, used to select patients for resection. Patients with LPPC may be better served with transplantation or liver-directed therapy.'

aS'A 12-core systematic biopsy that incorporates apical and far-lateral cores in the template distribution allows maximal cancer detection and avoidance of a repeat biopsy while minimizing the detection of insignificant prostate cancers. Magnetic resonance imaging-guided prostate biopsy has an evolving role in both initial and repeat prostate biopsy strategies, potentially improving sampling efficiency, increasing the detection of clinically significant cancers, and reducing the detection of insignificant cancers. Hematuria, hematospermia, and rectal bleeding are common complications of prostate needle biopsy, but are generally self-limiting and well tolerated. All men should receive antimicrobial prophylaxis before biopsy.'

aS'Achieving adequate growth after stage 1 palliation for children with single-ventricle heart defects often requires supplemental nutrition through enteral tubes. Significant practice variability exists between centers in the choice of feeding tube. The impact of feeding modality on the growth of patients with a single ventricle after stage 1 palliation was examined using the multiinstitutional National Pediatric Cardiology Quality Improvement Collaborative data registry.Characteristics of patients were compared by feeding modality, defined as oral only, nasogastric tube only, oral and nasogastric tube, gastrostomy tube only, and oral and gastrostomy tube. The impact of feeding modality on change in weight for age z-score during the interstage period, from stage 1 palliation discharge to stage 2 palliation, was evaluated by multivariable linear regression, adjusting for important patient characteristics and postoperative morbidities.In this cohort of 465 patients, all groups demonstrated improved weight for age z-score during the interstage period with a mean increase of 0.3\xc2\xb10.8. In multivariable analysis, feeding modality was not associated with differences in the change in weight for age z-score during the interstage period (P=.72). Risk factors for poor growth were a diagnosis of hypoplastic left heart syndrome (P=.003), vocal cord injury (P=.007), and lower target caloric goal at discharge (P=.001).In this large multicenter cohort, interstage growth improved for all groups and did not differ by feeding modality. With appropriate caloric goals and interstage monitoring, adequate growth may be achieved regardless of feeding modality and therefore local comfort and complication risk should dictate feeding modality.'

aS"There are many studies that evaluate the role of surgery in the treatment of complications of pediatric acute sinusitis; however there are few studies, if any that report the incidence of surgery following recovery from acute complicated sinusitis. The goal of this study was to report the incidence and indications for surgical intervention after recovery from complications of pediatric acute sinusitis.We reviewed the records of all children admitted to a tertiary care children's hospital between January 2005 and September 2010 with a diagnosis of sinusitis and an orbital or intracranial complication. Eighty-six patients met inclusion criteria. Charts were reviewed for type of complication, initial treatment (medical or surgical), type of procedure, secondary procedures, age, and comorbidities. Statistical analysis was completed using independent samples student t-tests and Mann-Whitney tests.A total of 86 patients with a mean age of 6.38 years (2 months to 18 years) were identified. Eighty patients had orbital complications while six presented with intracranial complications. Twenty-seven patients (31%) underwent sinus surgery during the acute phase of their illness whereas 59 patients (69%) were treated medically. After hospitalization and recovery for acute complicated sinusitis, surgery was performed on nine patients (mean age 4.86 years) within 1 month to 2 years post hospitalization. Of the nine patients who required secondary surgery following resolution of the initial complicated sinusitis, four patients were following initial surgical intervention and five patients had initially resolved their complication with medical therapy alone. Indications for subsequent surgery included failure of medical therapy for persistent rhinosinusitis (8 patients) and second complication (1 patient).This study suggests that following resolution of complicated pediatric rhinosinusitis, very few patients may need further surgical intervention. Subsequent intervention is best guided by clinical judgment, symptoms during outpatient clinic visits, and failure of medical therapy."

aS'HLA-DP antigens are beta-alpha heterodimers encoded by polymorphic HLA-DPB1 and -DPA1 alleles, respectively, in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with each other. Non-permissive unrelated donor (UD)-recipient HLA-DPB1 mismatches across three different T-cell epitope (TCE) groups are associated with increased mortality after hematopoietic SCT (HCT), but the role of HLA-DPA1 is unclear. We studied 1281 onco-hematologic patients after 10/10 HLA-matched UD-HCT facilitated by the National Marrow Donor Program. Non-permissive mismatches defined solely by HLA-DPB1 TCE groups were associated with significantly higher risks of TRM compared to permissive mismatches (hazard ratio (HR) 1.30, confidence interval (CI) 1.06-1.53; P=0.009) or allele matches. Moreover, non-permissive HLA-DPB1 TCE group mismatches in the graft versus host (GvH) direction significantly decreased the risk of relapse compared to permissive mismatches (HR 0.55, CI 0.37-0.80; P=0.002) or allele matches. Splitting each group into HLA-DPA1*02:01 positive or negative, in frequent LD with HLA-DPB1 alleles from two of the three TCE groups, or into HLA-DPA1 matched or mismatched, did not significantly alter the observed risk associations. Our findings suggest that the effects of clinically non-permissive HLA-DPB1 TCE group mismatches are independent of HLA-DPA1, and that selection of donors with non-permissive DPB1 TCE mismatches in GvH direction might provide some protection from disease recurrence.'

aS"As North American medical schools reformulate curricula in response to public calls for better patient safety, surprisingly little research is available to explain and improve the translation of medical students' knowledge and attitudes into desirable patient safety behaviors in the clinical setting. A total of 139 fourth-year medical students at Virginia Commonwealth University, School of Medicine, 96% of the 2010 graduating class, completed the Attitudes toward Patient Safety Questionnaire and a self-report of safety behaviors. The students were exposed to informal discussions of patient safety concepts but received no formal patient safety curriculum. Most students recognized errors and responded with attitudes supportive of patient safety but desired behaviors were less common. In particular, errors went unreported, owing, in part, to the relationships of power and social influence undergirding the traditional authority gradient in the culture of medicine. A deeper understanding of patient safety attitudes, behavior, and medical culture is required to better inform instructional design decisions that influence desired patient safety behaviors and improve patient care."

aS'The long-term effects of smoking and smoking cessation on markers of cardiovascular disease (CVD) prognosis obtained during treadmill stress testing (TST) are unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term effects of smoking cessation and continued smoking on TST parameters that predict CVD risk.In a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 5 smoking cessation pharmacotherapies, symptom-limited TST was performed to determine peak METs, rate-pressure product (RPP), heart rate (HR) increase, HR reserve, and 60-second HR recovery, before and 3 years after the target smoking cessation date. Relationships between TST parameters and treatments among successful abstainers and continuing smokers were evaluated using multivariable analyses.At baseline, the 600 current smokers (61% women) had a mean age of 43.4 (SD 11.5) years and smoked 20.7 (8.4) cigarettes per day. Their exercise capacity was 8.7 (2.3) METs, HR reserve was 86.6 (9.6)%, HR increase was 81.1 (20.9) beats/min, and HR recovery was 22.3 (11.3) beats. Cigarettes per day and pack-years were independently and inversely associated with baseline peak METs (P < .001), RPP (P < .01, pack-years only), HR increase (P < .05), and HR reserve (P < .01). After 3 years, 168 (28%) had quit smoking. Abstainers had greater improvements than continuing smokers (all P < .001) in RPP (2,055 mm Hg beats/min), HR increase (5.9 beats/min), and HR reserve (3.7%), even after statistical adjustment (all P < .001).Smokers with a higher smoking burden have lower exercise capacity, lower HR reserve, and a blunted exercise HR response. After 3 years, TST improvements suggestive of improved CVD prognosis were observed among successful abstainers.'

aS"Children who become overweight by age 2 years have significantly greater risks of long-term health problems, and children in low-income communities, where rates of low adult literacy are highest, are at increased risk of developing obesity. The objective of the Greenlight Intervention Study is to assess the effectiveness of a low-literacy, primary-care intervention on the reduction of early childhood obesity. At 4 primary-care pediatric residency training sites across the US, 865 infant-parent dyads were enrolled at the 2-month well-child checkup and are being followed through the 24-month well-child checkup. Two sites were randomly assigned to the intervention, and the other sites were assigned to an attention-control arm, implementing the American Academy of Pediatrics' The Injury Prevention Program. The intervention consists of an interactive educational toolkit, including low-literacy materials designed for use during well-child visits, and a clinician-centered curriculum for providing low-literacy guidance on obesity prevention. The study is powered to detect a 10% difference in the number of children overweight (BMI > 85%) at 24 months. Other outcome measures include observed physician-parent communication, as well as parent-reported information on child dietary intake, physical activity, and injury-prevention behaviors. The study is designed to inform evidence-based standards for early childhood obesity prevention, and more generally to inform optimal approaches for low-literacy messages and health literacy training in primary preventive care. This article describes the conceptual model, study design, intervention content, and baseline characteristics of the study population."

aS'Patients with obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS), even those generally compliant with CPAP therapy, often intermittently discontinue CPAP.Examine the impact of CPAP withdrawal on sleep, sleep disordered breathing (SDB), and daytime function in subjects with varying severity of OSAHS.Forty-two subjects (26M/16 F) with OSAHS (AHI4% = 45.2 \xc2\xb1 35.5/h pretreatment) on CPAP for 4 months were evaluated on the second night of CPAP withdrawal. Sleep architecture, SDB indices, and subjective/objective daytime function were assessed pretreatment, on CPAP therapy, and after CPAP withdrawal. Comparisons were made between pretreatment and CPAP withdrawal for the entire group, and for subgroups of mild/moderate (AHI4% < 30/h, n = 22) and severe (AHI4% > 30/h, n = 20) SDB.Overall, and for mild/moderate subjects, SDB indices returned to pretreatment values on CPAP withdrawal but with fewer apneas and more hypopneas/RERAs. For severe SDB, the event frequency (AI, AHI4%, and RDI) was lower and O2 desaturation was improved on CPAP withdrawal. Across SDB severity, sleep architecture showed lower %REM (15.6% vs 12.9%, P = 0.009) on the CPAP withdrawal compared to pretreatment. Stanford Sleepiness Score, MSLT, and PVT measures were not significantly different between pretreatment and CPAP withdrawal.Over a wide range of SDB severity CPAP withdrawal results in recurrence of SDB, albeit with less severe O2 desaturation. Subjective/objective daytime function returned to pretreatment levels. Sleep architecture changes on CPAP withdrawal (acute SDB) may reflect reduced sleep pressure compared to pretreatment chronic SDB. Our data suggest detrimental effects of even brief withdrawal of CPAP in subjects with both mild and severe OSAHS.Young LR; Taxin ZH; Norman RG; Walsleben JA; Rapoport DM; Ayappa I.

aS'The Ponseti method is a widely accepted and highly successful conservative treatment of pediatric clubfoot involving weekly manipulations and cast applications. Qualitative assessments have indicated the potential success of the technique with cast materials other than standard plaster of Paris. However, guidelines for clubfoot correction based on the mechanical response of these materials have yet to be investigated. The current study sought to characterize and compare the ability of three standard cast materials to maintain the Ponseti-corrected foot position by evaluating cast creep response. A dynamic cast testing device, built to model clubfoot correction, was wrapped in plaster of Paris, semi-rigid fiberglass, and rigid fiberglass. Three-dimensional motion responses to two joint stiffnesses were recorded. Rotational creep displacement and linearity of the limb-cast composite were analyzed. Minimal change in position over time was found for all materials. Among cast materials, the rotational creep displacement was significantly different (p < 0.0001). The most creep displacement occurred in the plaster of Paris (2.0\xc2\xb0), then the semi-rigid fiberglass (1.0\xc2\xb0), and then the rigid fiberglass (0.4\xc2\xb0). Torque magnitude did not affect creep displacement response. Analysis of normalized rotation showed quasi-linear viscoelastic behavior. This study provided a mechanical evaluation of cast material performance as used for clubfoot correction. Creep displacement dependence on cast material and insensitivity to torque were discovered. This information may provide a quantitative and mechanical basis for future innovations for clubfoot care.'

aS'The purpose of this methods article was to describe and evaluate outreach and engagement strategies designed to initially build county-wide awareness and support for the National Children\'s Study (NCS or the study) and subsequently to target the segment communities where recruitment for the study occurred. Selected principles from community outreach, social marketing, and health care system and personal referral formed the foundation for the strategies. The strategies included a celebration event, community advisory board, community needs assessment, building relationships with health care providers and systems, eliciting a network of study supporters, newsletters, appearances at local young family-oriented events (health fairs, parades), presentations to local community leaders, community forums, "branding" with assistance from a women-owned local marketing firm, and mailings including an oversized, second-touch postcard. Six months after study launch, approximately 4,600 study-eligible women were asked in a door-to-door survey if and how they became aware of the study. On average, 40% of eligible women reported being aware of the study. The most frequently cited strategy to cultivate their awareness was study-specific mailings. Awareness of the NCS increased by 7.5% among those receiving a second-touch postcard relative to controls (95% CIs [4.9, 10.7] z\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa05.347, p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.0000, d\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.16). Community outreach and engagement strategies, in particular the oversized postcard as a second-touch effort, may be used effectively by researchers for participant recruitment and by public health nurses for delivery of important population-focused messages.'

aS'Accurate histological quantification of astrocytosis after cerebral infarction is needed as this process may affect, and be affected by, many potential restorative treatments under investigation. We performed a systematic review to determine the most reliable histological method reported for measurement of postinfarction astrocytosis. We found reports of multiple techniques to quantify various parameters of immunohistochemical staining for the astrocyte marker glial fibrillary acidic protein on photomicrographs with several software packages. We found no studies directly comparing techniques. We conclude that the reported methods seem reasonable, but the descriptions were often insufficiently detailed to allow for replication, and the lack of comparison data makes the best method unclear. Further research is needed to optimize the analysis of this important tissue outcome after cerebral infarction.'

aS'Historically, methodological differences and lack of standardization led to between-laboratory variability in 25(OH)D results. Recent observations raised concern about persisting variability. This quality assurance exercise investigated 25(OH)D result comparability between laboratories.Serum pools (n=25) were prepared to contain endogenous 25(OH)D(2) and 25(OH)D(3) at 25(OH)D concentrations from ~12 to 150 nmol/l (5-60 ng/ml). Aliquots were sent to 8 laboratories utilizing various 25(OH)D assay methods including high performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection (LC-UV), LC with tandem mass spectroscopy detection (LC-MS/MS) or an automated immunoassay (Diasorin Liaison). The LC-UV results were selected as a referent to which all others were compared using linear regression and Bland-Altman analysis.Good correlation (R(2)=0.87 to 0.97) was observed for all laboratories. Modest systematic bias was observed for some laboratories ranging from a positive mean bias of 10.5 nmol/l (4.2 ng/ml) to a negative mean bias of 3.5 nmol/l (1.4 ng/ml). For the laboratory with the greatest bias, 22/25 results were numerically higher (mean +15.7%) than LC-UV results. For Liaison, the primary error was likely random, whereas the major LC-MS/MS assay error source was biases likely due to calibration issues.Modest inter-laboratory variability persists in serum 25(OH)D measurement. The National Institute of Standards and Technology 25(OH)D Standard Reference and calibration materials will further improve between-laboratory agreement for chromatography-based assays.'

aS'Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) demands high energy utilization due to continuous biventricular pacing. Current technology allows 6 pacing configurations for a bipolar left ventricular (LV) lead. Understanding the energy requirements for each configuration will allow optimization of pacing output.Pacing impedance, LV voltage threshold at 1.5 ms (rheobase) and 0.4 ms and chronaxie were obtained in 6 LV configurations in 49 consecutive patients undergoing CRT implantation or replacement. Strength-duration curves were derived using the Lapicque formula. Pacing impedances and voltage thresholds at 1.5 and 0.4 ms, calculated minimum threshold energy at chronaxie, current drain, energy thresholds at 0.4 ms, and strength-duration curves were statistically different between LV configurations (P<0.05). The lowest threshold energy requirements were found in Tip\xe2\x86\x92right ventricular (RV) coil and Tip\xe2\x86\x92Can configuration. Energy strength-duration curves involving the ring as the cathode (Ring\xe2\x86\x92RV, Ring\xe2\x86\x92Can, and Ring\xe2\x86\x92Tip) had the highest LV thresholds. The pacing configuration with the lowest energy threshold correlated 89% of the time with the lowest voltage threshold at 0.4 ms. The probability to reach LV thresholds <1.5 V at 0.4 ms was increased from 51% with 2 LV configurations to 67% with 6 LV configurations.Pacing impedance, LV thresholds, minimum threshold energy at chronaxie, current drain, voltage, and energy strength-duration curves were statistically different between LV pacing configurations. LV pacing configuration with the lowest voltage threshold does not always reflects the lowest energy threshold, particularly in the presence of a low impedance configuration. The availability of 6 LV configurations increases the probability of optimizing LV pacing output.'

aS"This study examined patient and dental provider experiences during the periodontal visit of diabetes screening approaches involving the collection of gingival crevicular blood (GCB) and finger stick blood (FSB) for haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) testing.At a large, urban, US periodontics and implant clinic, FSB samples from 120 patients and GCB samples from 102 of these patients were collected on special blood collection cards and sent to a laboratory for HbA1c testing, with test results sent to the patients from the laboratory. Quantitative and qualitative data from patients and qualitative data from providers were collected and analysed.Quantitative and qualitative data support the feasibility and acceptability of the approaches described. Themes that arose from the interviews with providers and patients include 'a good chance to check', 'patient choice', 'FSB versus GCB testing' and 'a new way of interacting and viewing the dental visit'.Periodontal patients and dental providers believe that the dental visit is an opportune site for diabetes screening and generally prefer GCB to FSB collection. HbA1c testing is well tolerated, convenient and acceptable to patients, and GCB testing reduces time and liability obstacles for dental providers to conduct diabetes screening."

aS'Ineffective nurse-physician communication in the nursing home setting adversely affects resident care as well as the work environment for both nurses and physicians. Using a repeated measures design, this quality improvement project evaluated the influence of SBAR (Situation; Background of the change; Assessment or appearance; and Request for action) protocol and training on nurse communication with medical providers, as perceived by nurses and physicians, using a pre-post questionnaire. The majority (87.5%) of nurses respondents found the tool useful to organize information and provide cues on what to communicate to medical providers. Limitations expressed by some nurses included the time to complete the tool, and communication barriers not corrected by the SBAR tool. Project findings, including reported physician satisfaction, support the use of SBAR to address both issues of complete documentation and time constraints.'

aS'The aim of this study is to rigorously evaluate the role of auditory brainstem response (ABR) testing in the diagnosis of vestibular schwannomas (VS).Searches were conducted in multiple online databases, supplemented by hand searches. From the studies chosen for final inclusion, relevant data were extracted and meta-analysis of pooled data was performed.623 studies were identified from which 43 met inclusion criteria for analysis (1978 to 2009) including 3314 patients. Pooled sensitivity for ABR detection of vestibular schwannomas was 93.4% (95% CI 92.6-94.3, P=0.0000). For tumors less than 1cm (8 studies, 176 patients) sensitivity was 85.8% (95% CI 80.6-90.1, P=0.0116). For tumors greater than 1cm (6 studies, 251 patients) pooled sensitivity was 95.6% (95% CI 93.1-98.2, P=0.0660). Sensitivity of ABR to detect extracanalicular tumors was higher than for intracanalicular tumors, though pooled data were not statistically valid. Pooled specificity (8 studies, 2432 patients) was 82.0% (95% CI 80.5-83.6, P=0.0000).Although MRI remains the gold standard, emerging trends towards more conservative management coupled with limited financial resources may prompt many clinicians to review the role of ABR testing in screening for retrocochlear pathology. In light of the high sensitivity and specificity of ABR testing for VS, we strongly urge its reconsideration as a useful diagnostic tool for patients with clinically suspected VS.'

aS'The authors of this study collaborated in the analysis of public health survey data in order to inform future statewide interventions that could systematically enhance depression screening and mental health service use for women of reproductive age. The primary objective of the study was to empirically inform and test the program theory components of a motivational interviewing intervention that we anticipate will guide statewide practice and policy priorities.Data were examined from a survey of healthcare practitioners statewide (n=1498) regarding their practices with and perceptions of perinatal depression care for women. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to measure two latent constructs: health provider confidence in the ability to diagnose and treat and the importance placed on screening and treatment. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test a program theory supporting motivational interviewing using a model implied relationship between confidence and importance on screening and treatment/referral practices.The data fit the model; the model provisionally supports motivational interviewing as an intervention influencing provider attitudes and practices surrounding perinatal depression screening and treatment/referral.Ultimately, study findings support statewide public health efforts to expand the role of health providers in recognizing and responding to perinatal depression and suggest that motivational interviewing techniques that augment importance and confidence may lead to enhanced screening and referral/treatment outcomes for pregnant and postpartum women.'

aS'Mealtime behavioral symptoms are distressing and frequently interrupt eating for the individual experiencing them and others in the environment. A computer-assisted coding scheme was developed to measure caregiver person-centeredness and behavioral symptoms for nursing home residents with dementia during mealtime interactions. The purpose of this pilot study was to determine the feasibility, ease of use, and inter-observer reliability of the coding scheme, and to explore the clinical utility of the coding scheme. Trained observers coded 22 observations. Data collection procedures were acceptable to participants. Overall, the coding scheme proved to be feasible, easy to execute and yielded good to very good inter-observer agreement following observer re-training. The coding scheme captured clinically relevant, modifiable antecedents to mealtime behavioral symptoms, but would be enhanced by the inclusion of measures for resident engagement and consolidation of items for measuring caregiver person-centeredness that co-occurred and were difficult for observers to distinguish.'

aS'Achieving and sustaining high levels of health care worker (HCW) compliance with contact isolation precautions is challenging. The aim of this study was to determine HCW work system barriers to and facilitators of adherence to contact isolation for patients with suspected or confirmed Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) using a human factors and systems engineering approach.This prospective cohort study took place between September 2013 and November 2013 at a large academic medical center (hospital A) and an affiliated Veterans Administration hospital (hospital B). A human factors engineering (HFE) model for patient safety, the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety model, was used to guide work system analysis and direct observation data collection. There were 288 observations conducted. HCWs and visitors were assessed for compliance with all components of contact isolation precautions (hand hygiene, gowning, and gloving) before and after patient contact. Time required to complete contact isolation precautions was measured, and adequacy of contact isolation supplies was assessed.Full compliance with contact isolation precautions was low at both hospitals A (7%) and B (22%). Lack of appropriate hand hygiene prior to room entry (compliance for hospital A: 18%; compliance for hospital B: 29%) was the most common reason for lack of full compliance. More time was required for full compliance compared with compliance with no components of contact isolation precautions before patient room entry, inside patient room, and after patient room exit (59.9 vs 3.2 seconds, P < .001; 507.3 vs 149.7 seconds, P = .006; 15.2 vs 1.3 seconds, P < .001, respectively). Compliance was lower when contact isolation supplies were inadequate (4% vs 16%, P = .005).Adherence to contact isolation precautions for CDI is a complex, time-consuming process. HFE analysis indicates that multiple work system components serve as barriers and facilitators to full compliance with contact isolation precautions and should be addressed further to prevent CDI.'

aS'OBJECTIVE To assess the effectiveness of prophylactic headache treatment in children and adolescents. DATA SOURCES PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Clinical Trials, and bibliography of retrieved articles through August 11, 2012. STUDY SELECTION Randomized trials of headache treatment among children and adolescents (&lt;18 years old). INTERVENTION Any placebo-controlled trial or comparisons between 2 or more active medications. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Number of headaches per month. RESULTS Among 21 included trials, there were 13 placebo-controlled and 10 active comparator trials (2 also included placebo). Twenty trials focused on episodic migraines and 1 on chronic daily headaches. Drugs more effective than placebo for episodic migraines (&lt;15 headaches per month) included topiramate (difference in headaches per month, -0.71; 95% CI, -1.19 to -0.24) and trazodone (-0.60; 95% CI, -1.09 to -0.11). Ineffective drugs included clonidine, flunarizine, pizotifen, propranolol, and valproate. A single trial of fluoxetine for chronic daily headaches found it ineffective. Patients given placebo experienced a significant (P\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0.03) decline in headaches, from 5.6 (95% CI, 4.52-6.77; Q\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa08.14 [Cochran Q is a measure of the heterogeneity of the included studies]) to 2.9 headaches per month (95% CI, 1.66-4.08; Q\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa04.72). Among the 10 active comparator trials, flunarizine was more effective than piracetam (difference in headaches per month, -2.20; 95% CI, -3.93 to -0.47) but no better than aspirin, dihydroergotamine, or propranolol. Propranolol was compared with valproate as well as behavioral treatment, and 2 studies compared different doses of topiramate; none of these trials showed significant differences. CONCLUSIONS Topiramate and trazodone have limited evidence supporting efficacy for episodic migraines. Placebo was effective in reducing headaches. Other commonly used drugs have no evidence supporting their use in children and adolescents. More research is needed.'

aS"We conducted a pilot survey to evaluate breast cancer patients' willingness to participate in a preoperative chemoprevention (ie, window-of-opportunity) study. Design A 27-question written survey was developed and administered to participants. Setting A breast cancer specialty clinic at the University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics. Participants 30 adult patients with newly diagnosed operable breast cancer participated after signing informed consent.A convenience sample of 30 participants was recruited from July 2005 through January 2006. Participants were administered the survey in clinic. Univariate ordinal logistic regression models were used to identify predictors of willingness to participate in window-of-opportunity trials.Overall, 26.7% of respondents were willing to participate in a research trial between the time of breast cancer diagnosis and surgery. Univariate ordinal logistic regression models identified that women with a prior history of breast cancer (P=0.060), prior research participation (P=0.006), more education (P=0.034), and self-reported breast cancer knowledge (P=0.043) were more willing to participate. On average, women preferred to have surgery 7 days (range 1-14) after their diagnosis, but the actual average wait time between diagnostic biopsy and surgery was 37.5 days (standard deviation = 23.4 days).There is ample time before breast surgery to conduct preoperative window-of-opportunity trials. Interventions aimed at expanding patients' breast cancer knowledge may improve accrual to window-of-opportunity studies."

aS"It is difficult to reliably detect the earliest signs of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated cognitive impairment. Our aim was to compare 3 psychometric methods of identifying amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) in a middle-aged longitudinal cohort enriched for AD risk.Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention (WRAP) participants with 3 waves of cognitive assessment over approximately 6 years were coded as meeting each of 3 psychometric aMCI definitions: (a) 'aMCI standard-baseline' used published norms to establish cutoffs for baseline performance; (b) 'aMCI robust-baseline' applied WRAP-specific robust norms to baseline, and (c) 'aMCI robust-multiwave' applied these robust norms across 3 waves of assessment. Each group was compared to a cognitively healthy subset.Half the aMCI standard-baseline and one third of the aMCI robust-baseline group reverted to normal ranges at follow-up. Only the aMCI robust-multiwave method had an aMCI \xc3\x97 age interaction showing significantly worse age-related memory declines in the aMCI group compared to the cognitively healthy group over 6 years of follow-up.Both cross-sectional methods showed instability over time, with many reverting to normal performance after baseline. The multiwave approach identified a group who showed progressive memory declines over 3 visits. Being able to detect progressive decline in late middle age is a critical step in improving prevention efforts."

aS'The mechanisms by which smoking cessation reduces cardiovascular disease risk are unclear. We evaluated longitudinal changes in carotid intima-media thickness among current smokers enrolled in a prospective, randomized smoking cessation clinical trial.Subjects were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 5 smoking cessation pharmacotherapies and underwent carotid ultrasonography with carotid intima-media thickness measurement. Subjects were classified as continuously abstinent (biochemically confirmed abstinence at 6 months, 1 year, and 3 years post-quit attempt), intermittently abstinent (reported smoking at one of the three time points), or smoked continuously (reported smoking at all three time points). The primary endpoint was the absolute change (mm) in carotid intima-media thickness (\xce\x94CIMT(max)) before randomization and 3 years after the target quit date. Pearson correlations were calculated and multivariable regression models (controlling for baseline CIMT(max) and research site) were analyzed. Among 795 subjects (45.2 \xc2\xb1 10.6 years old, 58.5% female), 189 (23.8%) were continuously abstinent, 373 (46.9%) smoked continuously, and 233 (29.3%) were abstinent intermittently. There was a greater increase in carotid intima-media thickness among subjects who were continuously abstinent than among those who smoked continuously (p = 0.020), but not intermittently (p = 0.310). Antihypertensive medication use (p = 0.001) and research site (p<0.001) independently predicted \xce\x94CIMTmax--not smoking status. The greatest increase in carotid intima-media thickness among continuous abstainers was related to increases in body-mass index (p = 0.043).Smoking status did not independently predict \xce\x94CIMT(max); increasing body-mass index and antihypertensive medication use were the most important independent predictors. The rapid reduction in cardiovascular disease events observed with smoking cessation is unlikely to be mediated by changes in subclinical atherosclerosis burden.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00332644.'

aS'To report the surgical treatment of hypertropia coexisting with exotropia, with either vertical offset surgery or additional vertical muscle surgery simultaneous to correction of the exotropia.A total of 35 patients with exotropia and hypertropia who underwent a horizontal muscle surgery for exotropia were included. To determine efficacy in resolving a vertical deviation in patients with exotropia, 28 patients were compared in 2 groups: those who underwent horizontal muscle surgery with vertical offset and those who underwent horizontal muscle surgery with additional vertical muscle surgery. An additional 7 patients who had exotropia and hypertropia but did not undergo vertically corrective surgery were included for comparison.Vertical offset of horizontal rectus muscles (4 mm) resulted in 8(Delta) correction of the distance hypertropia. Vertical rectus muscle recession used in the treatment of larger hypertropic deviations with exotropia had a 3(Delta) correction per 1 mm of recession. Success rates for hypertropia correction were similar between groups, 63% vertical offset and 71% vertical muscle groups; overcorrections occurred in 29% of the vertical muscle group. The vertical correction in both groups was stable in 88% over 6 months postoperatively.Vertical offset of the horizontal muscles simultaneous with exotropia correction has a beneficial effect in small-angle hypertropia (<14(Delta)). Vertical rectus muscle surgery in patients with hypertropia greater than 10(Delta) had equivalent success; however, in intermittent exotropia the hypertropia was prone to overcorrection.'

aS"The HeartMate II is the most frequently used left ventricular assist device (LVAD) in patients with end-stage heart failure. There is a paucity of data regarding its longitudinal cardiac effects, particularly that on diastole.This retrospective study was an evaluation of echocardiograms preoperatively and at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively in patients with a HeartMate II. Measurements included left ventricle (LV) dimensions, ejection fraction (EF), right ventricle (RV) size and function, parameters of diastolic function, and an analysis of mitral regurgitation (MR), tricuspid regurgitation (TR), aortic insufficiency (AI), and aortic valve thickening.Forty-seven patients were evaluated. LV dimensions decreased but EF, RV size, and RV function were unchanged. Right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) and diastolic parameters including mitral inflow E/A, deceleration time (DT), pulmonary vein inflow, left atrial size, and overall diastolic grade improved. LV relaxation measured by tissue Doppler (e') was unchanged and the E/e' ratio was also unchanged. Regarding valve function, MR decreased, TR was unchanged, and the aortic valve became increasingly thickened with increased AI severity.The HeartMate II unloads the LV as shown by decreased LV size, decreased MR, reduced RVSP, and improved patterns of mitral inflow. However, neither systolic function nor diastolic relaxation improves in this cohort. RV size and function also remain unchanged. The aortic valve shows increased thickening and AI likely from valve leaflet fusion. These results provide detailed functional and hemodynamic information regarding the longitudinal effects of the HeartMate II."

aS'Suicide attempt rates were assessed in 1306 subjects in this 6 year retrospective study of Bipolar disorder. Participants were Veterans from 5 different Veterans Administration Hospitals who met criteria for bipolar type 1 or 2 and who had at least one prescription for lithium or divalproex or both during the study period. This study focused on the impact of atypical antipsychotics on the suicide attempt rate when used in addition to or in place of lithium or divalproex. Medication exposure was calculated using computerized pharmacy records. Suicide attempts were established through chart review including emergency room records, inpatient records, and outpatient records. There were a total of 117 suicide attempts and 2 suicide completions during the study period. Most attempts (59%) occurred when patients were on no medications. Nearly 90% of subjects spent an average of 45 months during the 6 year period on none of the aforementioned medications. The lowest percentage of suicide attempts (15%) occurred while on lithium, 21% while on divalproex and 24% while on atypical antipsychotics. When total months of exposure were taken into account, the lowest attempt rate occurred on lithium plus divalproex (6.3 attempts per 10,000 months of exposure), followed by divalproex alone (7.0 attempts/10,000 months of exposure), and lithium alone (7.7 attempts per 10,000 months of exposure). Patients on atypical antipsychotics alone had an attempt rate of 26.1 attempts per 10,000 months of exposure. In this study, lithium and divalproex provided protection against suicide attempts. Results need to be replicated in future prospective studies and clearly strategies for improving medication compliance among veterans are warranted.'

aS'Cognitive changes related to cancer and its treatment have been intensely studied, and neuroimaging has begun to demonstrate brain correlates. In the first prospective longitudinal neuroimaging study of breast cancer (BC) patients we recently reported decreased gray matter density one month after chemotherapy completion, particularly in frontal regions. These findings helped confirm a neural basis for previously reported cognitive symptoms, which most commonly involve executive and memory processes in which the frontal lobes are a critical component of underlying neural circuitry. Here we present data from an independent, larger, more demographically diverse cohort that is more generalizable to the BC population. BC patients treated with (N=27) and without (N=28) chemotherapy and matched healthy controls (N=24) were scanned at baseline (prior to systemic treatment) and one month following chemotherapy completion (or yoked intervals for non-chemotherapy and control groups) and APOE-genotyped. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) showed decreased frontal gray matter density after chemotherapy, as observed in the prior cohort, which was accompanied by self-reported difficulties in executive functioning. Gray matter and executive symptom changes were not related to APOE \xce\xb54 status, though a somewhat greater percentage of BC patients who received chemotherapy were \xce\xb54 allele carriers than patients not treated with chemotherapy or healthy controls. These findings provide confirmatory evidence of frontal morphometric changes that may be a pathophysiological basis for cancer and treatment-related cognitive dysfunction. Further research into individual risk factors for such changes will be critical for development of treatment and prevention strategies.'

aS'There is growing interest in measuring social disability as a core element of autism spectrum disorders in medication trials. We conducted a secondary analysis on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist Social Withdrawal subscale using data from two federally-funded, multi-site, randomized trials with risperidone. Study 1 included 52 subjects assigned to placebo and 49 subjects to risperidone under double-blind conditions. Study 2 included 49 subjects assigned to risperidone only and 75 subjects assigned to risperidone plus parent training. After 8 weeks of treatment, all active treatments were superior to placebo (effect sizes ranging from 0.42 to 0.65). The findings suggest that the Social Withdrawal subscale may be a useful measure of social disability in acute treatment trials.'

aS'Angiosarcoma is an aggressive malignancy with endothelial differentiation and notoriously poor prognosis despite aggressive therapy. Limited data are available to guide management decisions. To address this limitation, we present a large retrospective analysis of angiosarcoma patients treated at a single institution over a 25-year period.To identify factors that impact angiosarcoma outcomes, we reviewed demographic, tumor, and treatment characteristics of angiosarcoma patients evaluated at the University of Wisconsin Hospital between 1987 and 2012.The cohort included 81 patients diagnosed at ages 19 to 90 years (median, 67 y). Fifty-five (68%) patients presented with localized disease, whereas 26 (32%) presented with metastases. The primary sites were visceral/deep soft tissue (42%), head and neck/cutaneous (37%), breast (16%), and limbs in the setting of Stewart-Treves (5%). The 5-year overall survival was 40% with a median of 16 months. By univariate analysis, significant adverse predictors of survival included metastases at presentation, visceral/deep soft tissue tumor location, tumor size > 5 cm, tumor necrosis, and the absence of surgical excision. A trend toward prolonged survival was observed with radiation therapy and for chemotherapy in patients with metastases.

aS'Because cystic fibrosis can be difficult to diagnose and treat early, newborn screening programs have rapidly developed nationwide but methods vary widely. We therefore investigated the costs and consequences or specific outcomes of the 2 most commonly used methods.With available data on screening and follow-up, we used a simulation approach with decision trees to compare immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) screening followed by a second IRT test against an IRT/DNA analysis. By using a Monte Carlo simulation program, variation in the model parameters for counts at various nodes of the decision trees, as well as for costs, are included and applied to fictional cohorts of 100\xe2\x80\x89000 newborns. The outcome measures included the numbers of newborns given a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis and costs of screening strategy at each branch and cost per newborn.Simulations revealed a substantial number of potential missed diagnoses for the IRT/IRT system versus IRT/DNA. Although the IRT/IRT strategy with commonly used cutoff values offers an average overall cost savings of $2.30 per newborn, a breakdown of costs by societal segments demonstrated higher out-of-pocket costs for families. Two potential system failures causing delayed diagnoses were identified relating to the screening protocols and the follow-up system.The IRT/IRT screening algorithm reduces the costs to laboratories and insurance companies but has more system failures. IRT/DNA offers other advantages, including fewer delayed diagnoses and lower out-of-pocket costs to families.'

aS'The objective was to evaluate the difference in timing (if any) of in-hospital carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or outcomes of CEA based on sex among men and women hospitalized for carotid artery disease.This was a retrospective cross-sectional study using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample Database. All patients from 2000-2009 who underwent CEA during their hospitalization were examined. International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision codes were used to identify patients who underwent CEA during hospitalization, stratify asymptomatic and symptomatic patients, determine time in days from admission to CEA, and examine in-hospital complications, including perioperative stroke, cardiac events, and death. Statistical analysis was performed with chi-squared and t-tests. Linear and logistic regression models were used to evaluate relationships between sex and outcomes. The main outcome measures were time from admission to surgery, in-hospital mortality, complications, mean duration of stay, and discharge disposition.Two hundred twenty-one thousand two hundred fifty three patients underwent CEA during hospitalization. More than 9% (9.2%) had symptomatic carotid artery disease. Among symptomatic patients, bivariate analysis found that women had a longer mean time from admission to surgery (2.8 vs. 2.6 days; P < 0.001) and a longer duration of hospital stay (6.4 vs. 5.9 days; P < 0.001) than their male counterparts. However, there was no difference between men and women with regard to rates of perioperative stroke, cardiac complications, myocardial infarction, or death. Among asymptomatic patients, women had a longer mean time from admission to surgery (0.53 vs. 0.48 days; P < 0.001) and a trend toward increased perioperative stroke (0.6% vs. 0.5%; P = 0.06), but a lower rate of cardiac complications (1.5% vs. 1.7%; P = 0.01) and in-hospital mortality (0.26% vs. 0.31%; P = 0.05). However, on multivariable analysis adjusting for differences in age, elective status, insurance, race, hospital location, hospital region, and hospital teaching status, there was no sex disparity in time from admission to surgery, regardless of symptomatic status. In addition, asymptomatic women were less likely than men to have a cardiac complication (odds ratio [OR]: 0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.83-0.97) or in-hospital mortality (OR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.70-0.98). Symptomatic women were also less likely than men to have a cardiac complication (OR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.63-0.97).In this decade-long national population-based study of hospitalized patients undergoing CEA, women had lower perioperative cardiac morbidity and mortality rates than men. After adjusting for patient, clinical, and hospital factors, there is no discernible difference in timing of CEA based on sex.'

aS'There is increasing evidence that proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) increase the rate of infections in patients with decompensated cirrhosis.To estimate the extent to which proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) increase the rate of infections among patients with decompensated cirrhosis.We conducted a retrospective propensity-matched new user design using US Veterans Health Administration data. Only decompensated cirrhotic patients from 2001 to 2009 were included. New PPI users after decompensation (n = 1268) were 1:1 matched to those who did not initiate gastric acid suppression. Serious infections, defined as infections associated with a hospitalisation, were the outcomes. These were separated into acid suppression-related (SBP, bacteremia, Clostridium difficile and pneumonia) and non-acid suppression-related. Time-varying Cox models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CIs of serious infections. Parallel analyses were conducted with H2 receptor antagonists (H2RA).More than half of persons with decompensated cirrhosis were new users of gastric acid suppressants, with most using PPIs (45.6%) compared with H2RAs (5.9%). In the PPI propensity-matched analysis, 25.3% developed serious infections and 25.9% developed serious infections in the H2RA analysis. PPI users developed serious infections faster than nongastric acid suppression users (adjusted HR: 1.66; 95% CI: 1.31\xe2\x80\x932.12). For acid suppression-related serious infections, PPI users developed the outcome at a rate 1.75 times faster than non-users (95% CI: 1.32\xe2\x80\x932.34). The H2RA findings were not statistically significant (HR serious infections: 1.59; 95% CI: 0.80\xe2\x80\x933.18; HR acid suppression-related infections: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.31\xe2\x80\x932.73).Among patients with decompensated cirrhosis, proton pump inhibitors but not H2 receptor antagonists increase the rate of serious infections.'

aS"The role of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative Genetics Core is to facilitate the investigation of genetic influences on disease onset and trajectory as reflected in structural, functional, and molecular imaging changes; fluid biomarkers; and cognitive status. Major goals include (1) blood sample processing, genotyping, and dissemination, (2) genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of longitudinal phenotypic data, and (3) providing a central resource, point of contact and planning group for genetics within the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Genome-wide array data have been publicly released and updated, and several neuroimaging GWAS have recently been reported examining baseline magnetic resonance imaging measures as quantitative phenotypes. Other preliminary investigations include copy number variation in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease and GWAS of baseline cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers and longitudinal changes on magnetic resonance imaging. Blood collection for RNA studies is a new direction. Genetic studies of longitudinal phenotypes hold promise for elucidating disease mechanisms and risk, development of therapeutic strategies, and refining selection criteria for clinical trials."

More than 130 birth cohorts focusing on asthma and allergy have been initiated in the last 30 years. A National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; Mechanisms of the Development of Allergy (MeDALL; Framework Programme 7 of the European Commission) joint workshop was held in Bethesda, Maryland, on September 11-12, 2012, with 3 objectives: (1) documenting the knowledge that asthma/allergy birth cohorts have provided, (2) identifying the knowledge gaps and inconsistencies, and (3) developing strategies for moving forward, including potential new study designs and the harmonization of existing asthma birth cohort data. The meeting was organized around the presentations of 5 distinct workgroups: (1) clinical phenotypes, (2) risk factors, (3) immune development of asthma and allergy, (4) pulmonary development, and (5) harmonization of existing birth cohorts. This article presents the workgroup reports and provides Web links (AsthmaBirthCohorts.niaid.nih.gov or www.medall-fp7.eu), where the reader will find tables describing the characteristics of the birth cohorts included in this report, the type of data collected at differing ages, and a selected bibliography provided by the participating birth cohorts.'

aS'Underlying the importance of research on the biology of aging is the fact that many nations face the demographic reality of a rapidly aging populace and the looming healthcare challenges that it brings. This reality is a result of aging itself being the most significant risk factor for a range of the most prevalent diseases, including many cancers, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Accordingly, interventions are sorely needed that would be able to delay or prevent diseases and disorders associated with the aging process and thereby increase the period of time that aging individuals are in good health (the health-span). Caloric restriction (CR) has emerged as a model of major interest as it is widely agreed that CR is the most potent environmental intervention that delays the onset of aging and extends life span in diverse experimental organisms. A better understanding of the mechanisms by which CR delays aging will reveal new insights into the aging process and the underlying causes of disease vulnerability with age. These novel insights will allow the development of novel treatments and preventive measures for age-associated diseases and disorders.'

Multimodality imaging consisting of thoracic radiographs, transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography, fluoroscopy-guided selective angiography, computed tomography angiogram (CTA) and magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA), was performed on this patient. The defect included a left-to-right shunting anomalous vessel between the ascending aorta and main pulmonary artery, along with a dissecting aneurysm of the main and right pulmonary artery. An MRA post-processing technique (PC VIPR) was used to allow for high resolution angiographic images and further assessment of the patient's hemodynamics prior to surgical correction. This case report describes the clinical course of a canine patient with a rare form of congenital cardiac disease, and the multiple imaging modalities that were used to aid in diagnosis and treatment."

aS'There is a fairly consistent, albeit non-universal body of research documenting cognitive declines after cancer and its treatments. While few of these studies have included subjects aged 65 years and older, it is logical to expect that older patients are at risk of cognitive decline.\xc2\xa0Here, we use breast cancer as an exemplar disease for inquiry into the intersection of aging and cognitive effects of cancer and its therapies. There are a striking number of common underlying potential biological risks and pathways for the development of cancer, cancer-related cognitive declines, and aging processes, including the development of a frail phenotype. Candidate shared pathways include changes in hormonal milieu, inflammation, oxidative stress, DNA damage and compromised DNA repair, genetic susceptibility, decreased brain blood flow or disruption of the blood-brain barrier, direct neurotoxicity, decreased telomere length, and cell senescence. There also are similar structure and functional changes seen in brain imaging studies of cancer patients and those seen with "normal" aging and Alzheimer\'s disease. Disentangling the role of these overlapping processes is difficult since they require aged animal models and large samples of older human subjects. From what we do know, frailty and its low cognitive reserve seem to be a clinically useful marker of risk for cognitive decline after cancer and its treatments. This and other results from this review suggest the value of geriatric assessments to identify older patients at the highest risk of cognitive decline. Further research is needed to understand the interactions between aging, genetic predisposition, lifestyle factors, and frailty phenotypes to best identify the subgroups of older patients at greatest risk for decline and to develop behavioral and pharmacological interventions targeting this group. We recommend that basic science and population trials be developed specifically for older hosts with intermediate endpoints of relevance to this group, including cognitive function and trajectories of frailty. Clinicians and their older patients can advance the field by active encouragement of and participation in research designed to improve the care and outcomes of the growing population of older cancer patients.'

aS'Rapid magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisition is typically achieved by acquiring all or most lines of k-space after one radio frequency (RF) excitation. Parallel imaging techniques can further accelerate data acquisition by acquiring fewer phase-encoded lines and utilizing the spatial sensitivity information of the RF coil arrays. The goal of this study was to develop a new MRI data acquisition and reconstruction technique that is capable of reconstructing a two-dimensional (2D) image using highly undersampled k-space data without any special hardware. Such a technique would be very efficient, as it would significantly reduce the time wasted during multiple RF excitations or phase encoding and gradient switching periods.The essence of this new technique is to densely sample a small number of projections, which should be acquired at an angle other than 0\xc2\xb0 or multiples of 45\xc2\xb0. This results in multiple rays passing through a voxel and provides new and independent measurements for each voxel. Then the images are reconstructed using the unique information coming from these projections combined with RF coil sensitivity profiles. The feasibility of this new technique was investigated with realistic simulations and experimental studies using a phantom and compared with conventional nonuniform fast Fourier transform technique. Eigenvalue analysis and error calculations were conducted to find optimal projection angles and minimum requirements for dense sampling.Reconstruction of 64 \xc3\x97 64 images was done using a single projection from simulated data under different noise levels. Simulated reconstruction was also tested with two projections to assess the improvement. Experimental phantom images were reconstructed at higher resolution using 4, 8, and 16 projections. Cross-sectional profiles illustrate that the new technique resolved compartment boundaries clearly.Simulations demonstrated that only a single k-space line might be sufficient to reconstruct a 2D image using this new technique. Experimental results showed that this is a promising new technique for fast imaging. Using the information from the simulations and fast imaging parameters published in the literature, it could be predicted that a two-dimensional image could be acquired in about 10 ms. One of the major advantages of this new technique is that it does not require any additional hardware and can be implemented on a conventional scanner with an eight-channel coil.'

aS'In methylome-wide association studies (MWAS) there are many possible differences between cases and controls (e.g. related to life style, diet, and medication use) that may affect the methylome and produce false positive findings. An effective approach to control for these confounders is to first capture the major sources of variation in the methylation data and then regress out these components in the association analyses. This approach is, however, computationally very challenging due to the extremely large number of methylation sites in the human genome.We introduce MethylPCA that is specifically designed to control for potential confounders in studies where the number of methylation sites is extremely large. MethylPCA offers a complete and flexible data analysis including 1) an adaptive method that performs data reduction prior to PCA by empirically combining methylation data of neighboring sites, 2) an efficient algorithm that performs a principal component analysis (PCA) on the ultra high-dimensional data matrix, and 3) association tests. To accomplish this MethylPCA allows for parallel execution of tasks, uses C++ for CPU and I/O intensive calculations, and stores intermediate results to avoid computing the same statistics multiple times or keeping results in memory. Through simulations and an analysis of a real whole methylome MBD-seq study of 1,500 subjects we show that MethylPCA effectively controls for potential confounders.MethylPCA provides users a convenient tool to perform MWAS. The software effectively handles the challenge in memory and speed to perform tasks that would be impossible to accomplish using existing software when millions of sites are interrogated with the sample sizes required for MWAS.'

aS'It has been recently demonstrated that interleukin 1\xce\xb2 (IL-1\xce\xb2) plays a central role in monosodium urate crystal-induced inflammation and that the NALP3 inflammasome plays a major role in IL-1\xce\xb2 production. These discoveries have offered new insights into the pathogenesis of acute gouty arthritis. In this review, we discuss the molecular mechanisms by which monosodium urate crystals induce acute inflammation and examine the mechanisms of action (MOAs) of traditional anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, colchicine, and glucocorticoids) and biologic agents (e.g., the IL-1\xce\xb2 antagonists anakinra, rilonacept, and canakinumab) to understand how their MOAs contribute to their safety profiles. Traditional anti-inflammatory agents may act on the IL-1\xce\xb2 pathway at some level; however, their MOAs are broad-ranging, unspecific, and biologically complex. This lack of specificity may explain the range of systemic adverse effects associated with them. The therapeutic margins of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, colchicine, and glucocorticoids are particularly low in elderly patients and in patients with cardiovascular, metabolic, or renal comorbidities that are frequently associated with gouty arthritis. In contrast, the IL-1\xce\xb2 antagonists act on very specific targets of inflammation, which may decrease the potential for systemic adverse effects, although infrequent but serious adverse events (including infection and administration reactions) have been reported. Because these IL-1\xce\xb2 antagonists target an early event immediately downstream from NALP3 inflammasome activation, they may provide effective alternatives to traditional agents with minimal systemic adverse effects. Results of ongoing trials of IL-1\xce\xb2 antagonists will likely provide clarification of their potential role in the management of acute gouty arthritis.'

aS'To present a summary of current scientific evidence about the cannabinoid, cannabidiol (CBD) with regard to its relevance to epilepsy and other selected neuropsychiatric disorders. We summarize the presentations from a conference in which invited participants reviewed relevant aspects of the physiology, mechanisms of action, pharmacology, and data from studies with animal models and human subjects. Cannabis has been used to treat disease since ancient times. \xce\x94(9) -Tetrahydrocannabinol (\xce\x94(9) -THC) is the major psychoactive ingredient and CBD is the major nonpsychoactive ingredient in cannabis. Cannabis and \xce\x94(9) -THC are anticonvulsant in most animal models but can be proconvulsant in some healthy animals. The psychotropic effects of \xce\x94(9) -THC limit tolerability. CBD is anticonvulsant in many acute animal models, but there are limited data in chronic models. The antiepileptic mechanisms of CBD are not known, but may include effects on the equilibrative nucleoside transporter; the orphan G-protein-coupled receptor GPR55; the transient receptor potential of vanilloid type-1 channel; the 5-HT1a receptor; and the \xce\xb13 and \xce\xb11 glycine receptors. CBD has neuroprotective and antiinflammatory effects, and it appears to be well tolerated in humans, but small and methodologically limited studies of CBD in human epilepsy have been inconclusive. More recent anecdotal reports of high-ratio CBD:\xce\x94(9) -THC medical marijuana have claimed efficacy, but studies were not controlled. CBD bears investigation in epilepsy and other neuropsychiatric disorders, including anxiety, schizophrenia, addiction, and neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. However, we lack data from well-powered double-blind randomized, controlled studies on the efficacy of pure CBD for any disorder. Initial dose-tolerability and double-blind randomized, controlled studies focusing on target intractable epilepsy populations such as patients with Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes are being planned. Trials in other treatment-resistant epilepsies may also be warranted. A PowerPoint slide summarizing this article is available for download in the Supporting Information section here.'

aS'Microbes are readily cultured from epithelial surfaces of the skin, mouth, and colon. In the last 10 years, culture-independent DNA-based techniques demonstrated that much more complex microbial communities reside on most epithelial surfaces; this includes the lower airways, where bacterial culture had failed to reliably demonstrate resident bacteria. Exposure to a diverse bacterial environment is important for adequate immunological development. The most common microbes found in the lower airways are also found in the upper airways. Increasing abundance of oral characteristic taxa is associated with increased inflammatory cells and exhaled nitric oxide, suggesting that the airway microbiome induces an immunological response in the lung. Furthermore, rhinovirus infection leads to outgrowth of Haemophilus in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and human immunodeficiency virus-infected subjects have more Tropheryma whipplei in the lower airway, suggesting a bidirectional interaction in which the host immune defenses also influence the microbial niche. Quantitative and/or qualitative changes in the lung microbiome may be relevant for disease progression and exacerbations in a number of pulmonary diseases. Future investigations with longitudinal follow-up to understand the dynamics of the lung microbiome may lead to the development of new therapeutic targets.'

aS"Autism spectrum disorders, or pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs), are neurodevelopmental disorders defined by qualitative impairment in social interaction, impaired communication and stereotyped patterns of behavior. The most common forms of PDD are autistic disorder (autism), Asperger's disorder and PDD not otherwise specified. Recent surveillance studies reveal an increase in the prevalence of autism and related PDDs. The use of pharmacologic agents in the treatment of these disorders can reduce the impact of interfering symptoms, providing relief for affected individuals and their families.This review examines results from neurobiologic research in an attempt to both elucidate the pathophysiology of autism and guide the development of pharmacologic agents for the treatment of associated symptoms. The safety and efficacy data of drugs currently in clinical use for the treatment of these symptoms, as well as pharmaceuticals currently under development, are discussed.This comprehensive review will deepen the reader's current understanding of the research guiding the pharmacologic treatment of symptoms associated with autism and related PDDs. Areas of focus for future research are also discussed. The need for large-scale investigation of some commonly used pharmacologic agents, in addition to the development of drugs with improved efficacy and safety profiles, is made evident.Despite progress in the development of pharmacologic treatments for a number of interfering symptom domains associated with autism and other PDDs, a great deal of work remains."

aS'It is now recognized that a majority of single ventricle patients, those with functionally univentricular hearts, who have survived palliative cavopulmonary connection will experience circulatory failure and end-organ dysfunction due to intrinsic inadequacies of a circulation supported by a single ventricle. Thus, there are an increasing number of patients with functional single ventricles presenting with failing circulations that may benefit from mechanical circulatory support (MCS). The paucity of experience with MCS in this population, even at high volume cardiac centers, contributes to limited available data to guide MCS device selection and management. Thus, a registry of MCS in this population would be beneficial to the field. A conference was convened in January 2012 of pediatric and adult cardiologists, pediatric cardiac intensivists, congenital heart surgeons, and adult cardiothoracic surgeons to discuss the current state of MCS, ventricular assist device, and total artificial heart therapy for patients who have undergone cavopulmonary connection, either superior cavopulmonary connection or total cavopulmonary connection. Specifically, individual experience and challenges with VAD therapy in this population was reviewed and creation of a multiinstitutional registry of MCS/ventricular assist device in this population was proposed. This document reflects the consensus from the meeting and provides a descriptive overview of the registry referred to as Mechanical Support as Failure Intervention in Patients with Cavopulmonary Shunts.'

Outcomes for patients without complete resection are dismal, and the benefit of adjuvant therapy is uncertain. A 9-year-old girl presented with a large right-sided cardiac mass. After biopsy, the tumor was classified as an undifferentiated sarcoma. Resection was not feasible due to apparent invasion of the right ventricle and atrioventricular groove. Treatment with oral etoposide resulted in a 97% reduction in tumor volume and allowed for complete resection of residual tumor. She is alive with no evidence of disease 25 months from diagnosis.'

aS"This article challenges recent assumptions that physicians may ethically and legally prescribe psychopharmacological enhancement drugs to patients and the counterintuitive notion that in some cases ingesting an enhancement drug constitutes the more ethical choice than foregoing this option. Enhancement proponents have touted modafinil as an ideal mechanism to improve concentration, alertness, and forego sleep and keep pace with our society's demands. However, patients who use modafinil for these reasons risk potentially severe side effects and addiction, and face unintended consequences related to their cognitive, emotive, and physiological functioning. Importantly, prescribing a controlled substance such as modafinil for performance enhancement and sleep avoidance runs contrary to a physician's ethical duty to the patient and the standard of practice set forth in legal requirements governing the prescription of controlled substances."
