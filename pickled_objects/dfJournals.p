aS'ompB mutants of Escherichia coli K-12 are markedly deficient in porin in their outer membrane. This results in a decreased rate of uptake for many substrates: the maltose pore (lambda receptor) can in some circumstances, in the absence of the periplasmic maltose-binding protein, compensate for the consequent defects in permeability to lactose, mannitol, glycylglycyl-L-valine, and tri-L-ornithine. It is postulated that the maltose-binding protein associates with the maltose pore and confers on it the specificity for maltose, and that the absence of the maltose-binding protein leaves the pore open and results in enhanced transmembrane diffusion of molecules other than maltose. This paper presents evidence to support this hypothesis.'

aS'Several lysosomal glycosidase activities were examined in vitro during heat-induced germination of Dictyostelium discoideum spores and were found not to be coordinately controlled. The level of beta-glucosidase activity increased significantly during the emergence stage of germination. Both alpha-glucosidase and N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase activities remained relatively constant until postemergence, when they increased slightly; alpha-mannosidase activity decreased during all stages of germination. The activity of beta-galactosidase increased slightly during spore swelling, fell below the level initially found in spores at zero time, and increased slightly during postemergence. The expression of all of these enzyme activities, except the increase in beta-galactosidase, appeared to require protein synthesis. Spores in the lag phase of germination which were exposed to severe environmental stress were deactivated and exhibited reduced levels of alpha-glucosidase, beta-glucosidase, and N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase activities. Prolonged heat activation treatment reduced the levels of lysosomal glycosidase activities in postactivated spores but did not change the subsequent enzyme patterns during the spore-swelling and emergence stages of germination.'

aS'The initiation of patulin biosynthesis in submerged batch cultures of Penicillium urticae NRRL 2159A was investigated at the enzyme level. In contrast to earlier studies, this study achieved a clear temporal separation of growing cells devoid of secondary metabolism-specific enzymes from nongrowing cells, which rapidly produce these enzymes. A spore inoculum, silicone-treated flasks, and two new media which supported a rapid, pellet-free, filamentous type of growth were used. In yeast extract-glucose-buffer medium, a marked drop in the specific growth rate (approximately equal to 0.26 h-1) coincided with the appearance of the first pathway-specific enzyme, 6-methylsalicylic acid synthetase, at about 19 h after inoculation. About 3 h later, when replicatory growth had ceased entirely, the sparsely branched mycelia (length, approximately equal to 550 microns) began the rapid synthesis of a later pathway enzyme, m-hydroxybenzyl alcohol dehydrogenase. A similar sequence of events occurred in a defined nitrate-glucose-buffer medium; 12 other strains or isolates of P. urticae, as well as some patulin-producing aspergilli, behaved in a similar manner. The age at which a culture produced m-hydroxybenzyl alcohol dehydrogenase was increased by increasing the nutrient nitrogen content of the medium or by decreasing the size of the spore inoculum. In each instance the appearance of enzyme was determined by the nutritional status of the culture and not by its age. A similar appearance of patulin pathway enzymes occurred when a growing culture was resuspended in a nitrogen-free 4% glucose solution with or without 0.1 M phosphate (pH 6.5). The appearance of both the synthetase and the dehydrogenase was arrested by the addition of cycloheximide (0.4 to 5 micrograms/ml) or actinomycin D (20 to 80 micrograms/ml). This requirement for de novo protein and ribonucleic acid syntheses was confirmed by the incorporation of labeled leucine into the dehydrogenase, and the possibility that latent or preformed proteins were being activated was eliminated.'

aS'A homologous series of spermidine analogs was synthesized with the general structure NH3+ (CH2)nNH2+(CH2)3NH3+, where spermidine has n = 4. The influence of these compounds on growth and on the syntheses of protein and messenger ribonucleic acid was examined in a spermidine auxotroph of Escherichia coli. All of the homologs tested were taken up by the cells to an intracellular level equivalent to the level of spermidine which gives optimal growth. With increasing chain length of the homologs, there was reduced ability to stimulate growth. The homologs with n = 7 and n = 8 were essentially inactive. A similar specificity was observed when the ability of the homologs to restore the rates of protein and messenger ribonucleic acid chain elongation was compared to that of spermidine. These results suggest that a definite spatial arrangement of the amino groups of spermidine is required for productive interaction at its intracellular site(s) of action.'

aS"The tif-1 mutation in the recA gene of Escherichia coli caused, at 40 degrees C, lethal cell filamentation, induction of the recA protein, mutagenesis, and, in lambda lysogens, prophage induction. The presence of plasmid R100.1 in tif-1 strains suppressed tif-mediated cell filamentation and killing, recA protein induction, and prophage induction in lysogens. It also reduced mutagenesis in a tif-1 sfiA11(R100.1) strain. Plasmids F'lac, P1, and pMB9, in contrast, had little or no effect on tif-mediated induction of lambda. The presence of R100.1 did not inhibit the induction of the recA protein or of lambda by ultraviolet irradiation or mitomycin C treatment of tif-1(R100.1) or tif-1(lambda)(R100.1) strains."

aS'Crude extracts of the wild-type Klebsiella pneumoniae reduced C2H2 with either pyruvate or formate as reductant (specific activity, 3 nmol min-1 mg of protein-1), whereas crude extracts of nifF mutant were almost inactive (specific activity, 0.05). However, activity in the latter extracts was stimulated by adding Azotobacter chroococcum flavodoxin (specific activity, 10). Thus, nifF mutants may lack an electron transport factor. Crude extracts of nifJ mutants had about 20% of the wild-type level of active MoFe protein, and thus nifJ has a presumptive role in maintaining active MoFe protein. Studies on pyruvate or formate as reductants for nitrogenase in extracts of the nifJ mutants suggest in addition a role in electron input to nitrogenase for the following reasons. (i) Nitrogenase activity with these reductants was very low (specific activity, 0.06) and was not stimulated by extra MoFe protein or the flavodoxin. (ii) Activity was increased by adding a crude extract of a mutant lacking the structural nif genes (specific activity, 1) or a crude extract of the nifF mutant (specific activity, 4).'

aS'In Salmonella typhimurium, glucose, mannose, and fructose are normally transported and phosphorylated by the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system. We have investigated the transport of these sugars and their non-metabolizable analogs in mutant strains lacking the phospho-carrier proteins of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system, the enzymes I and HPr, to determine whether the sugar-specific, membrane-bound components of the phosphonenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system, the enzymes II, can catalyze the uptake of these sugars in the absence of phosphorylation. This process does not occur. We have also isolated mutant strains which lack enzyme I and HPr, but have regained the ability to grow on mannose or fructose. These mutants contained elevated levels of mannokinase (fructokinase). In addition, growth on mannose required constitutive synthesis of the galactose permease. When strains were constructed which lacked the galactose permease, they were unable to grow even on high concentrations of mannose, although elevated levels of mannokinase (fructokinase) were present. These results substantiate the conclusion that the enzymes II of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system are unable to carry out facilitated diffusion.'

aS'A spontaneous thiosine-resistant mutant of Escherichia coli was shown to have the following characteristics: lowered initial rate of lysine uptake and lowered plateau level of accumulation of exogenous lysine by both the lysine-specific and the general basic amino acid transport systems; altered repressibility of these two lysine transport systems; a derepressed level of lysine decarboxylase; normal growth rate; parental levels of lysyl-transfer ribonucleic acid synthetase and the inducible and constitutive arginine and ornithine decarboxylases. Both the mutant (lysP) and its parent (lysP+) feed a lysine auxotroph when they are plated in proximity on solid medium. However, the feeding response was observable after 1 day less of incubation when the mutant was the feeding strain. Despite the derepressed level of lysine decarboxylase in exponential cultures of the mutant extracts of these cultures had no detectable cadaverine pool. Conjugation experiments established the following gene order: gyrA (formerly nalA) lysP metG his. All thiosine-resistant recombinants assayed showed reduced lysine transport. In many of these recombinants the derepression of lysine decarboxylase was not expressed.'

aS'Bacillus subtilis YY88 synthesizes increased amounts of extracellular and membrane-bound proteases. More than 99% of the extracellular protease activity is accounted for by an alkaline serine protease and a neutral metalloprotease. An esterase having low protease activity accounts for less than 1% of the secreted protease. These enzymes were purified to homogeneity. Molecular weights of approximately 28,500 and 39,500 were determined for the alkaline and neutral proteases, respectively. The esterase had a molecular weight of approximately 35,000. Amino-terminal amino acid sequences were determined, and the actions of a number of inhibitors were examined. Membrane vesicles contained bound forms of alkaline and neutral proteases and a group of previously undetected proteases (M proteases). Membrane-bound proteases were extracted with Triton X-100. Membrane-bound alkaline and neutral proteases were indistinguishable from the extracellular enzymes by the criteria of molecular weight, immunoprecipitation, and sensitivity to inhibitors. The M protease fraction accounted for approximately 7% of the total activity in Triton X-100 extracts of membrane vesicles. The M protease fraction was partially fractionated into four species (M1 through M4) by ion-exchange chromatography. Immunoprecipitation and sensitivity to inhibitors distinguished membrane-bound alkaline and neutral proteases from M proteases. In contrast to alkaline and neutral proteases, proteases M2 and M3 exhibited exopeptidase activity.'

aS'The relationship between protein synthesis and processes of cell division was studied by using synchronized cells of Bacillus subtilis 168. The addition of chloramphenicol at the beginning of synchronous growth prevented septum formation and cell division, suggesting the requirement of protein synthesis for the processes of cell division. Experiments in which the drug was added to the cells at different cell ages showed that the protein synthesis required for the initiation of septum formation was completed at about 15 min and that the protein synthesis required for cell division was completed at about 45 min. By interpreting the result from the concept of the transition point for protein synthesis, it was suggested that the processes of cell division in B. subtilis require at least two kinds of protein molecules which are synthesized at distinct stages in the cell cycle. This was supported by the result of an experiment in which starvation and the readdition of a required amino acid to exponentially growing cells induced two steps of synchronous cell division. Further, the two transition points are in agreement with the estimations obtained by residual division after the inhibition of protein synthesis in asynchronous cells. The relationship of the timing between the completion of chromosome replication and the two transition points was also studied.'

aS'A meiotic fine structure map of the gal4 locus was constructed, which extended over 0.44 units on the chromosome (units in percent frequency of supposed recombination). Several nonsense gal4 mutations (four UAA and two supposed UGA [gal4-62 and gal4-69]) were placed at various sites on the map. In reversion experiments with 20 independently isolated gal4 mutants, only the gal4-62 and gal4-69 alleles, which are located at the same site on the map, could revert to overcome the superrepression of gal80s-1 spontaneously with a frequency of approximately 4 x 10(-7). Secondary mutations in the revertants occurred in the region of gal4-62 or were due to unlinked suppressors. A total of 15 GAL81 mutations in 19 isolates were found to be located in the same region as gal4-62 by three-point crosses with the aid of gal4 mutants; the other four could not be analyzed. The reverted gal4 gene and GAL81 mutations were semidominant over the wild-type GAL4+ allele and fully dominant over a nonsense gal4 mutation. Four suppressors (one dominant and three recessive) effective against gal4-62 and gal4-69 were isolated. The dominant suppressor was also effective against three independent, authentic auxotrophic UGA nonsense mutations, and one of the three recessive suppressors were effective against the authentic auxotrophic UAA and UAG mutations. These results strongly support the idea that the gal4 locus is expressed constitutively and codes for a regulatory protein. The GAL81 site mapped inside the locus codes for a part of the gal4 protein but does not work as an operator.'

aS'Several different strains of Escherichia coli were grown on a variety of carbon sources under various growth conditions. Lactose was added (usually at mid-log phase), and the concentrations of the products of beta-galactosidase action on this sugar (galactose, glucose, and allolactose) were determined at various times thereafter in the total culture and in the medium. It was found that with each strain, with all carbon sources, and under all of the conditions studied, a very large proportion of the products were found in the medium. Control studies were carried out which showed that these results were not artifacts of the method of separating the cells from the medium. The results also did not arise from the secretion of beta-galactosidase into the medium, from the diffusion of substrates and products into and out of the cells due to leaks in the membrane, or from faults in the method of sugar analysis. In addition, the results showed that there were very high levels of products inside the cells under the conditions used and that the efflux of the products was rapid. The efflux might be energetically advantageous to the cell as well as being a means of storing excess products until needed.'

aS'Trichosporon cutaneum readily metabolized protocatechuate, homoprotocatechuate, and gentisate, but lacked ring fission dioxygenases for these compounds. Benzoic, salicylic, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic, and gentisic acids were converted into beta-ketoadipic acid before entry into the Krebs cycle. Benzoic acid gave rise successively to 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, protocatechuic acid, and hydroxyquinol (1,3,4-trihydroxybenzene), which underwent ring fission to maleylacetic acid. Salicylate and 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate were both initially metabolized to give catechol. 2,3-Dihydroxybenzoate was the substrate for a specific nonoxidative decarboxylase induced by salicylate, although 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate was not a catabolite of salicylate. Gentisate was metabolized to maleylacetic acid and was also readily attacked by salicylate hydroxylase at each stage of a partial purification procedure. Phenylacetic acid was degraded through 3-hydroxyphenylacetic, homogentisic, and maleylacetoacetic acids to acetoacetic and fumaric acids. All the reactions of these catabolic sequences were catalyzed by cell extracts, supplemented with reduced pyridine nucleotide coenzymes where necessary, except for the hydroxylations of benzoic and phenylacetic acids which were demonstrated with cell suspensions and isotopically labeled substrates.'

aS'Ornithine transcarbamylase was stabilized in cell-free extracts by the presence of either carbamyl phosphate or glycerol. The enzyme was rapidly purified by a procedure consisting of ion-exchange chromatography and electrofocusing. The native molecular weight of the enzyme was determined by gel filtration to be 110,000. A subunit molecular weight of 36,000 was determined by polyacrylamide electrophoresis under dissociating conditions. These findings indicated a trimeric quaternary structure for the enzyme. The isoelectric point of the purified enzyme was 4.75, and no evidence of multiple forms of active enzyme was found in either crude or purified preparations. An inactive form of the enzyme appeared upon storage in the absence of stabilization buffer.'

aS'We have compared the rate of assembly of outer membrane proteins including the lipoprotein in a pair of isogenic mlpA+ (lpp+) and mlpA (lpp) strains by pulse-chase experiments. The rate of assembly of the mutant prolipoprotein into the outer membrane was slightly slower than that of the wild-type lipoprotein. The rate of assembly of protein I and protein H-2 was similar in the wild type and the mutant, whereas the rate of assembly of protein II into the outer membrane was slightly reduced in the mutant strain. The organization of outer membrane was slightly reduced in the mutant strain. The organization of outer membrane proteins in the mutant cells appeared not to be grossly altered, based on the apparent resistance (or susceptibility) of these proteins toward trypsin treatment and their resistance to solubilization by Sarkosyl. Like the wild-type lipoprotein, the mutant prolipoprotein in the outer membrane was resistant to trypsin. On the other hand, the prolipoprotein in the cytoplasmic membrane fraction of the mutant cell envelope was susceptible to trypsin digestion. We conclude from these data that proteolytic cleavage of prolipoprotein is not essential for the translocation and proper assembly of lipoprotein into outer membrane.'

aS'Three mutants of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae which require exogenous ethanolamine or choline were isolated. The mutants map to a single locus (cho1) on chromosome V. The lipid composition suggests that cho1 mutants do not synthesize phosphatidylserine under any growth conditions. If phosphatidylethanolamine or phosphatidylcholine, which are usually derived from phosphatidylserine, were synthesized from exogenous ethanolamine or choline, the mutants grew and divided relatively normally. However, mitochondrial abnormalities were evident even when ethanolamine and choline were supplied. Diploids homozygous for the cho1 mutation were defective in sporulation. Growth on nonfermentable carbon sources was slow, and a high proportion of respiratory-deficient (petite) cells were generated in cho1 cultures.'

aS'Heterokaryons from Mucor racemosus were produced from two auxotrophic strains of the fungus. Germlings were converted to spheroplasts by using commercial chitinase and purified Myxobacter AL-1 chitosanase. Spheroplasts from the auxotrophic strains were mixed and fused in solutions of polyethylene glycol and CaCl2. Under optimal conditions, prototrophic heterokaryons were formed at a frequency of about 5%.'

aS"Hypertoxinogenic mutants of Vibrio cholerae frequently possess mutations in a chromosomal locus called htx. Spontaneously occurring phenotypic revertants were shown to fall into three classes. One class retained the htx mutation and therefore represented a second-site mutation(s) capable of suppressing the Htx phenotype, whereas the other two classes represented strains that had lost the htx mutation. One of the latter two classes appeared to be composed of true genetic revertants, whereas the third class consisted of clones that had replaced htx with a new mutation conferring a hypotoxinogenic phenotype. Several rare N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine-induced hypotoxinogenic mutants selected by rif comutation also map in the same region as htx. This new locus, which mediates the hypotoxinogenic phenotype in these trains and potentially in some hypertoxinogenic phenotypic revertants, has been designated ltx. htx and ltx appear to be regulatory loci, since mutations in both sites alter the level of cholera toxin A and B subunit production coordinately. The genetic data also support a model in which htx- and ltx- are allelic states of the same Tox regulatory locus."

aS'A mutant temperature-sensitive for R-plasmid replication, Rms201ts14, was isolated from composite plasmid Rms201 after mutagenesis of P1 transducing lysate with 100 mM hydroxylamine for 40 h at 37 degrees C. When Escherichia coli ML1410(Rms201ts14)(+) was grown at temperatures between 40 and 42 degrees C in L broth, antibiotic-sensitive cells were segregated. When the incubation temperature of ML1410(Rms201ts14)(+) in L-broth was shifted to 42 from 30 degrees C, the increase in the number of antibiotic-resistant cells ceased 90 min after the temperature shift. However, the total number of cells continuously increased, and only 3% of the cells retained the plasmid at 5 h after the temperature shift to 42 degrees C. At 30 degrees C the amounts of covalently closed circular deoxyribonucleic acid per chromosome of Rms201ts14 and Rms201 were 3.8 and 6.3%, respectively. Incorporation of radioactive thymidine into the covalently closed circular deoxyribonucleic acid of Rms201ts14 did not take place at 42 degrees C, whereas radioactive thymidine was incorporated into the covalently closed circular deoxyribonucleic acid of Rms201 at a rate of 4%/chromosome even at 42 degrees C. The synthesis of plasmid covalently closed circular deoxyribonucleic acid in a cell harboring Rms201ts14 was almost completely blocked at 42 degrees C. These results indicated that the gene(s) responsible for plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid replication was affected in the mutant Rms201ts14. Temperature-sensitive miniplasmid pMSts214, which has a molecular weight of 5.3 x 10(6) and encodes ampicillin resistance, was isolated from Rms201ts14. Similarly, miniplasmid pMS201, which encodes single ampicillin resistance, was isolated from its parent, Rms201, and its molecular weight was 4.7 x 10(6). These results indicate that the gene(s) causing temperature sensitivity for replication of Rms201 resides on the miniplasmid.'

aS"A group of at least four distinct nucleases designated DcI through DcIV were isolated from cellular extracts of group A streptococcal strain S43 and shown to be antigenically similar to streptococcal extracellular deoxyribonuclease (DNase) D. These cellular endonucleases degraded single- and double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) as well as ribonucleic acid (RNA) to acid-soluble oligonucleotides. The products of digestion of DNA bore 5'-terminal phosphates, and in partial digests pdX-pdG linkages were most susceptible and pdA-pdX linkages were most resistant to nuclease action. The enzymes had pH optima of 8.0 to 8.5, were inhibited by NaCl, were unaffected by sulfhydryl modifying reagents, and absolutely required a divalent cation. Nucleases DcIII and DcIV were apparently hydrophobic in nature since they required the presence of detergents for migration on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. All four nucleases were electrophoretically distinct on such gels, from each other, and from DNase D. Molecular weights of DcI and DcII were similar to that of DNase D, suggesting that the mobility differences of these enzymes at least are reflections of differing net charges. It is suggested that the cellular nucleases represent a group of processing intermediates in the maturation and excretion of DNase D."

aS'Selenomonas ruminantium was found to possess two pathways for NH4+ assimilation that resulted in net glutamate synthesis. One pathway fixed NH4+ through the action of an NADPH-linked glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH). Maximal GDH activity required KCl (about 0.48 M), but a variety of monovalent salts could replace KCl. Complete substrate saturation of the enzyme by NH4+ did not occur, and apparent Km values of 6.7 and 23 mM were estimated. Also, an NADH-linked GDH activity was observed but was not stimulated by KCl. Cells grown in media containing non-growth-rate-limiting concentrations of NH4+ had the highest levels of GDH activity. The second pathway fixed NH4+ into the amide of glutamine by an ATP-dependent glutamine synthetase (GS). The GS did not display gamma-glutamyl transferase activity, and no evidence for an adenylylation/deadenylylation control mechanism was detected. GS activity was highest in cells grown under nitrogen limitation. Net glutamate synthesis from glutamine was effected by glutamate synthase activity (GOGAT). The GOGAT activity was reductant dependent, and maximal activity occurred with dithionite-reduced methyl viologen as the source of electrons, although NADPH or NADH could partially replace this artificial donor system. Flavin adenine dinucleotide, flavin mononucleotide, or ferredoxin could not replace methyl viologen. GOGAT activity was maximal in cells grown with NH4+ as sole nitrogen source and decreased in media containing Casamino Acids.'

aS'Inhibition of cellular adenylate cyclase activity by sugar substrates of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system was reliant on the activities of the protein components of this enzyme system and on a gene designated crrA. In bacterial strains containing very low enzyme I activity, inhibition could be elicited by nanomolar concentrations of sugar. An antagonistic effect between methyl alpha-glucoside and phosphoenolpyruvate was observed in permeabilized Escherichia coli cells containing normal activities of the phosphotransferase system enzymes. In contrast, phosphoenolpyruvate could not overcome the inhibitory effect of this sugar in strains deficient for enzyme I or HPr. Although the in vivo sensitivity of adenylate cyclase to inhibition correlated with sensitivity of carbohydrate permease function to inhibition in most strains studied, a few mutant strains were isolated in which sensitivity of carbohydrate uptake to inhibition was lost and sensitivity of adenylate cyclase to regulation was retained. These results are consistent with the conclusions that adenylate cyclase and the carbohydrate permeases were regulated by a common mechanism involving phosphorylation of a cellular constituent by the phosphotransferase system, but that bacterial cells possess mechanisms for selectively uncoupling carbohydrate transport from regulation.'

aS'The phosphoglycerate transport system was employed to supply energy-depleted, lysozyme-treated Salmonella typhimurium cells with a continuous intracellular source of phosphoenolpyruvate. When the cells had been induced to high levels of the phosphoglycerate transport system, a low extracellular concentration of phosphoenolpyruvate (0.1 mM) half maximally stimulated uptake of methyl alpha-glucoside via the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system. If the phosphoglycerate transport system was not induced before energy depletion, 100 times this concentration of phosphoenolpyruvate was required for half-maximal stimulation. Phosphoenolpyruvate could not be replaced by other energy sources if potassium fluoride (an inhibitor of enolase) was present. Inhibition of [14C]-glycerol uptake into energy-depleted cells by methyl alpha-glucoside was demonstrated. A concentration of phosphoenolpyruvate which stimulated methyl alpha-glucoside accumulation counteracted the inhibitory effect of the glucoside. In the presence of potassium fluoride, phosphoenolpyruvate could not be replaced by other energy sources. Inhibition of glycerol uptake by methyl alpha-glucoside in intact untreated cells was also counteracted by phosphoenolpyruvate, but several energy sources were equally effective; potassium fluoride was without effect. These and other results were interpreted in terms of a mechanism in which the relative proportions of the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of a cell constituent influence the activity of the glycerol transport system.'

aS'The predominant membrane lipid in Bacillus megaterium ATCC 14581, phosphatidylglycerol (PG), is present in two distinct pools, as shown by [32P]phosphate incorporation and chase experiments. One pool (PGt) undergoes rapid turnover of the phosphate moiety, whereas the second pool (PGs) exhibits metabolic stability in this group. The phosphate moiety of the other major phospholipid, phosphatidylethanolamine, is stable to turnover. [32P]phosphate- and [2-3H]glycerol-equilibrated cultures yielded the following glycerolipid composition: 56 mol% PG (34 mol% PGt and 22 mol% PGs), 21 mol% phosphatidylethanolamine, 1 to 2 mol% phosphatidylserine, 20 mol% diglycerides, less than 0.5 mol% cardiolipin, and 0.2 to 0.4 mol% lysophosphatidylglycerol. Accumulation of PG was halted immediately after the addition of cerulenin, an inhibitor of de novo fatty acid synthesis, whereas phosphatidylethanolamine accumulation continued at the expense of the diglyceride and PG pools. Strikingly, initial rates of [32P]phosphate incorporation into PG were unaffected by cerulenin. In control cultures at 35 degrees C, incorporation of [32P]phosphate into PG exhibited a biphasic time course, whereas incorporation into phosphatidylethanolamine was concave upward and lagged behind that of PG during the initial rapid phase of PG incorporation. Finally, levels of lysophosphatidylglycerol expanded rapidly after cerulenin addition at 20 degrees C, but not at 35 degrees C. Moreover, incorporation of [32P]phosphate into lysophosphatidylglycerol lagged behind incorporation into PG in both the presence and absence of cerulenin at 20 and 35 degrees C.'

aS'Pulse-chase experiments in Bacillus megaterium ATCC 14581 with [U-14C]palmitate, L-[U-14C]serine, and [U-14C]glycerol showed that a large pool of phosphatidylglycerol (PG) which exhibited rapid turnover in the phosphate moiety (PGt) underwent very rapid interconversion with the large diglyceride (DG) pool. Kinetics of DG labeling indicated that the fatty acyl and diacylated glycerol moieties of PGt were also utilized as precursors for net DG formation. The [U-14C]glycerol pulse-chase results also confirmed the presence of a second, metabolically stable pool of PG (PGs), which was deduced from [32P]phosphate studies. The other major phospholipid, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), exhibited pronounced lags relative to PG and DG in 14C-fatty acid, [14C]glycerol, and [32P]phosphate incorporation, but not for incorporation of L-[U-14C]serine into the ethanolamine group of PE or into the serine moiety of the small phosphatidylserine (PS) pool. Furthermore, initial rates of L-[U-14C]serine incorporation into the serine and ethanolamine moieties of PS and PE were unaffected by cerulenin. The results provided compelling in vivo evidence that de novo PGt, PS, and PE synthesis in this organism proceed for the most part sequentially in the order PGt yields PS yields PE rather than via branching pathways from a common intermediate and that the phosphatidyl moiety in PS and PE is derived largely from the corresponding moiety in PGt, whereas the DG pool indirectly provides an additional source for this conversion by way of the facile PGt in equilibrium or formed from DG interconversion.'

aS'3-Deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate (KDO)-8-phosphate synthetase has been purified 450-fold from frozen Escherichia coli B cells. The purified enzyme catalyzed the stoichiometric formation of KDO-8-phosphate and Pi from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and D-arabinose-5-phosphate. The enzyme showed no metal requirement for activity and was inhibited by 1 mM Cd2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, and Hg2+. The inhibition by Hg2+ could be reversed by dithiothreitol. The optimum temperature for enzyme activity was determined to be 45 degrees C, and the energy of activation calculated by the Arrhenius equation was 15,000 calories (ca. 3,585 J) per mol. The enzyme activity was shown to be pH and buffer dependent, showing two pH optima, one at pH 4.0 to 6.0 in succinate buffer and one at pH 9.0 in glycine buffer. The isoelectric point of the enzyme was 5.1. KDO-8-phosphate synthetase had a molecular weight of 90,000 +/- 6,000 as determined by molecular sieving through G-200 Sephadex and by Ferguson analysis using polyacrylamide gels. Based on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the 90,000-molecular-weight native enzyme was composed of three identical subunits, each with an apparent molecular weight of 32,000 +/- 4,000. The enzyme had an apparent Km for D-arabinose-5-phosphate of 2 X 10(-5) M and an apparent Km for PEP of 6 X 10(-6) M. No other sugar or sugar-phosphate could substitute for D-arabinose-5-phosphate. D-Ribose-5-phosphate was a competitive inhibitor of D-arabinose-5-phosphate, with an apparent Ki of 1 X 10(-3) M. The purified enzyme has been utilized to synthesize millimole quantities of pure KDO-8-phosphate.'

aS'The process of ribosome formation during repair of sublethal heat injury was examined in Staphylococcus aureus. Sublethal heating of this organism results in the degradation of the 30S ribosomal subunit and alteration of the 50S subunit. Cells recovering from sublethal injury were examined for changes with time in the sedimentation and electrophoretic properties of ribonucleoprotein particles and ribonucleic acid, respectively. When cells were allowed to recover in [3H]uridine, the label could be followed into ribonucleic acid species that coelectrophoresed with 23S and 16S ribonucleic acid. Three ribonucleoprotein particles (49S, 36S, and 30S) were isolated from repairing cells by sedimentation through sucrose gradients. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that the 49S particle contained 23S ribonucleic acid, the 36S particle contained both 23S ribonucleic acid and 16S precursor and mature ribonucleic acid, and the 30S particle contained 16S and precursor 16S ribonucleic acid. Particles with similar sedimentation properties were found in unheated cells.'

aS'Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (EC 4.1.1.39) has been purified to homogeneity from glutamate-CO2-thiosulfate-grown Thiobacillus intermedius by pelleting the protein from the 93,000 X g supernatant fluid followed by ammonium sulfate fractionation and sedimentation into a discontinuous sucrose density gradient. The molecular weight of the native protein approximated that of the higher plant enzyme (550,000) based on its relative electrophoretic mobility in polyacrylamide disc gels compared with that of standards of known molecular weight, including crystalline tobacco ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase. Sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis in 12% polyacrylamide disc gels and Sephadex G-100 chromatography in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate indicated that the purified Thiobacillus protein, like the tobacco enzyme, consisted of two types of nonidentical subunits. The molecular weights of the large and small subunits were estimated to be about 55,000 and 13,000, respectively, by means of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The carboxylase activity of the protein purified from spinach leaves and T. intermedius responded similarly to the effectors reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and 6-phosphogluconate. Contrary to a previous report (K. Purohit, B. A. McFadden, and A. L. Cohen, J. Bacteriol. 127:505-515, 1976), these results indicate that ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase purified from Thiobacillus intermedius closely resembles the higher plant enzyme with respect to quaternary structure, molecular weight, and regulatory properties.'

aS'Regulation of the synthesis of the proteins of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system was systematically studied in wild-type and mutant strains of Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli. The results suggest that enzyme I and HPr as well as the glucose-specific and the mannose-specific enzymes II are synthesized by a mechanism which depends on (i) cyclic adenosine monophosphate and its receptor protein; (ii) extracellular inducer; (iii) the sugar-specific enzyme II complex which recognizes the inducing sugar; and (iv) the general energy-coupling proteins of the phosphotransferase system, enzyme I and HPr.'

aS'Recently reported research from this laboratory has demonstrated the autotrophic growth of certain hydrogen-uptake-positive strains of Rhizobium japonicum and defined minimal conditions for such growth. Ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase has been detected in autotrophically growing cells, but at low specific activity. Moreover, growth rates were low, and growth ceased at low cell densities. We report here improved autotrophic growth rates of R. japonicum SR through the use of a modified mineral salts/vitamins medium and a programmed increase in oxygen tension as autotrophic growth proceeds. Under these conditions, ribulose, 1,5-biphosphate carboxylase activity increased greater than 10-fold and crude-extract-uptake-hydrogenase activities were from 20 to 47 times those heretofore reported for free-living R. japonicum. It is likely that previous assays for these enzymes were done on preparations of cells in which their synthesis had been partially repressed. The contribution of CO2 fixation to organic carbon accumulation in autotrophic cells was assessed as sufficient to support observed growth. Enzymological determination of the product of carbon fixation has established a stoichiometric ratio of 1.9 mol of 3-phosphoglycerate per mol of CO2 fixed and unequivocally assigns the role of carbon fixation catalysis to ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase. Ammonium served best as a nitrogen source, nitrate was less effective, and gaseous nitrogen would not support autotrophic growth. Ecological, evolutionary, and practical considerations of autotrophy in the rhizobia are briefly discussed in the light of our findings.'

aS'We have isolated three strains of Klebsiella aerogenes that failed to show repression of glutamine synthetase even when grown under the most repressing conditions for the wild-type strain. These mutant strains were selected as glutamine-independent derivatives of a strain that is merodiploid for the glnA region and contains a mutated glnF allele. The mutation responsible for the Gln+ phenotype in each strain was tightly linked to glnA, the structural gene for glutamine synthetase, and was dominant to the wild-type allele. These mutations are probably lesions in the control region of the glnA gene, since each mutation was cis-dominant for constitutive expression of the enzyme in hybrid merodiploid strains. Strains harboring this class of mutations were unable to produce a high level of glutamine synthetase unless they also contained an intact glnF gene, and unless cells were grown in derepressing medium. This study supports the idea that the glnA gene is regulated both positively and negatively, and that the deoxyribonucleic acid sites critical for positive control and negative control are functionally distinct.'

aS'When Escherichia coli are grown in the presence of 5-fluorouracil, the 5-fluorouracil is incorporated almost exclusively into ribonucleic acid as fluorouridylate. In this study, small but detectable amounts were incorporated into ribonucleic acid as fluorocytidylate and into deoxyribonucleic acid as fluorodeoxyuridylate and fluorodeoxycytidylate. The amount of 5-fluorouracil found in deoxyribonucleic acid as fluorodeoxyuridylate increased 50-fold when the cells were deficient in both deoxyuridine triphosphatase and uracil-deoxyribonucleic acid glycosylase activities. Therefore, the same mechanisms which excluded uracil from deoxyribonucleic acid in vivo also excluded 5-fluorouracil. Even though purified uracil-deoxyribonucleic acid glycosylase excised 5-fluorouracil from deoxyribonucleic acid at only 5% the rate with which it excised uracil, most of the 5-fluorouracil excised from deoxyribonucleic acid in vivo was apparently excised directly by uracil-deoxyribonucleic acid glycosylase rather than by repair initiated by excision of uracil.'

aS'The effect of a number of conditions on the amount of cyanophycin granule polypeptide [multi-L-arginyl poly(L-aspartic acid)] formed in the unicellular cyanobacterium Aphanocapsa 6308 was determined. Light, CO2, sulfur, and phosphorus starvation as well as the addition of arginine to culture media increased the amount of cyanophycin granule polypeptide in cells when compared with that in cells grown under conditions optimal for growth. Nitrogen limitation and reduction of growth temperature to 30 degrees C decreased the amount of cyanophycin granule polypeptide on a dry-weight basis. Shift-up and shift-down experiments suggest cyanophycin granule polypeptide may be a reserve nitrogen polymer in Aphanocapsa 6308.'

aS'The production of deuterated methane by Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum in H2O-D2O mixtures was examined by high-resolution mass spectrometry. The hydrogen in the methane arose solely from water and not from hydrogen gas. Hydrogen gas served only as an electron source in methanogenesis. A whole-cell product isotope discrimination of 1.5 favoring hydrogen over deuterium was observed in methane production in 81 atom% deuterated water. The distribution of deuterated methane species is described by a simple model of the overall reaction.'

aS'During the yeast-to-hyphae transition of the dimorphic phycomycete Mucor racemosus, there was a 30- to 50-fold increase in the activity of ornithine decarboxylase. Increased enzyme activity preceded the emergence of germ tubes and reached a maximum before conversion was completed. Subsequently, enzyme levels rapidly declined, despite the continuation of mycelial growth. Both putrescine and spermidine blocked the enzyme activity response. Protein synthesis was required for the increase in enzyme activity during morphogenesis. A combination of actinomycin D and netropsin inhibited ribonucleic acid synthesis but failed to inhibit the increase in ornithine decarboxylase activity. There was a twofold increase in the enzyme half-life during morphogenesis with either trichodermin or verrucarin to inhibit protein synthesis.'

aS'Two galactose uptake systems were found in the mycelia of Neurospora crassa. In glucose-grown mycelia, galactose was transported by a low-affinity (Km = 400 mM) constitutive system which was distinct from the previously described glucose transport system I (R. P. Schneider and W. R. Wiley, J. Bacteriol. 106:479--486, 1971). In carbon-starved mycelia or mycelia incubated with galactose, a second galactose transport activity appeared which required energy, had a high affinity for galactose (Km = 0.7 mM), and was shown to be the same as glucose transport system II. System II also transported mannose, 2-deoxyglucose, xylose, and talose and is therefore a general monosaccharide transport system. System II was derepressed by carbon starvation, completely repressed by glucose, mannose, and 2-deoxyglucose, and partially repressed by fructose and xylose. Incubation with galactose yielded twice as much activity as starvation. This extra induction by galactose required protein synthesis, and represented an increase in activity of system II rather than the induction of another transport system. Glucose, mannose, and 2-deoxyglucose caused rapid degradation of preexisting system II; fructose and xylose caused a slower degradation of activity.'

aS'The release of iron from ferrisiderophores (microbial ferric-chelating iron transport cofactors) by cell-free extracts of Bacillus megaterium was demonstrated. Reductive transfer of iron from ferrisiderophores to the ferrous-chelating agent ferrozine was measured spectrophotometrically. This ferrisiderophore reductase activity (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate:ferrisiderophore oxidoreductase) was associated primarily with the cell soluble rather than particulate (membrane) fraction. Ferrisiderophore reductase was inhibited by oxygen and required the addition of a reductant (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate was most effective) for maximal activity. The activity was destroyed by both heat and protease treatments and was inhibited by iodoacetamide treatment. Ferrisiderophore reductase activity for several microbial ferrisiderophores was measured; highest activity was displayed for ferrischizokinen, the ferrisiderophore produced by this organism. The Km and Vmax values of the reductase for ferrischizokinen were 2.5 x 10(-4) M and 35.7 nmol/min per mg of the ferrisiderophore reductase reaction. Preliminary fractionation of the cell soluble material by gel filtration chromatography resulted in the demonstration of ferrisiderophore reductase activity in three peaks of different molecular weight. Ferrisiderophore reductase probably mediates entrance of iron into cellular metabolism.'

aS'Rhizobium meliloti exhibited behavior resembling that of other chemotactic bacteria. Nonflagellated, nonmotile but flagellated, and nonchemotactic mutants were isolated, and genetic mapping placed all three types of lesions within a small region of the R. Meliloti chromosome. Results from nodulation experiments performed with these mutants indicate that members of the three classes (Fla-, Mot-, and Che-) infect and produce as many nodules on alfalfa plants as does the wild-type strain.'

aS"Extracts of Methanosarcina barkeri possess a specific methyltransferase that catalyzes the transfer of the methyl group of methanol to 2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid. Over a fourfold range in added 2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid, the formation of 2-(methylthio)ethanesulfonic acid exhibited a 1:1 ratio to 2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid added. This reaction required adenosine 5'-triphosphate; a maximal ratio (mole/mole) of 85 methyl groups was transferred per adenosine 5'-triphosphate added. The methyltransferase was found in extracts of methanol-grown cells as well as in extracts of hydrogen-grown cells. In extracts of cells grown on either substrate, 2-(methylthio)ethanesulfonic acid was formed from added methanol or methylamine but not from acetate."

aS'Encystment and germination of Blastocladiella emersonii zoospores involve a rapid and radical transformation of the motile but nongrowing spore into a sessile, growing germling. Certain inorganic ions, notably 50 mM KCl, are efficient inducers of germination. By use of the carbocyanine dye DiO-C6-(3), we found that KCl depolarizes the plasma membrane of zoospores and noted good correlation between depolarization and subsequent germination. Zoospores avidly accumulated K+ ions from the medium, attaining an internal concentration of over 50 mM and a concentration gradient of 2,500. Sodium ions, by contrast, were expelled. Internal K+ was required for normal germination but its function is not known. Zoospores also took up considerable amounts of calcium; most of this was associated with the external surface and appeared to be necessary for maintenance of zoospore integrity. KCl (50 mM) and other salts displaced surface calcium but this was not in itself sufficient to induce germination. The calcium ionophore A23187, in the presence of external calcium, was an effective inducer of germination, suggesting a possible role for cytosolic calcium in triggering the transformation. We propose that the first step in the induction of germination by salts is depolarization of the plasma membrane; subsequent events require the intervention of cytoplasmic signals.'

aS'We investigated the regulation of genes concerned with nitrogen metabolism by oxygen in the facultative anaerobe Klebsiella pneumoniae. We found oxygen to be required for the expression of the hut operons; the effect of O2 on the glutamine synthetase and urease was less pronounced than on the hut operons. Glutamine synthetase was transiently repressed during the transition from an aerobic to an anaerobic environment. Regulation of hut by O2 suppressed the effect of nitrogen limitation on the expression of these genes.'

aS'Three wild strains of bovine septicemic Escherichia coli were selected on the basis of their production of a toxin lethal for mice and chickens and their characteristic surface antigen. The transfer of these virulence (Vir) properties from two of the three to recipient E. coli was detected after mating. One Vir plasmid (pJL1) was derepressed for transfer and associated with mobilization of chromosomal markers. The other, pJL2, was repressed. Both plasmids were tagged with transposon Tn5 (kanamycin resistance), and transfer parameters of the tagged plasmids were studied. The Tn5 insertion in pJL2 usually increased transfer efficiency 100-fold. Plasmid pJL1 was classified as a member of the FIV incompatibility group. A pJL1::Tn5 derivative plasmid was incompatible with ColV1. Plasmid pJL2 behaved as an fi+ plasmid. Both plasmids pJL1 and pJL2 had a molecular weight of 92 x 10(6) and were present at about four copies per chromosome; their deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) structures were not identical on the basis of restriction enzyme analysis. DNA-DNA hybridization revealed a polynucleotide sequence homology of at least 58% between the two plasmids. No plasmids could be detected in one wild or certain laboratory-derived Vir+ E. coli strains.'

aS"Imidazole, histidine, histamine, histidinol phosphate, urocanic acid, or imidazolepropionic acid were shown to induce the L-arabinose operon in the absence of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate. Induction was quantitated by measuring the increased differential rate of synthesis of L-arabinose isomerase in Escherichia coli strains which carried a deletion of the adenyl cyclase gene. The crp gene product (cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate receptor protein) and the araC gene product (P2) were essential for induction of the L-arabinose operon by imidazole and its derivatives. These compounds were unable to circumvent the cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate in the induction of the lactose or the maltose operons. The L-arabinose regulon was catabolite repressed upon the addition of glucose to a strain carrying an adenyl cyclase deletion growing in the presence of L-arabinose with imidazole. These results demonstrated that several imidazole derivatives may be involved in metabolite gene regulation (23)."

aS'Deoxyribonucleic acid fragments containing the structural genes for several trimethoprim-resistant dihydrofolate reductases from naturally occurring plasmids were inserted into small cloning vehicles. The genetic expression of these hybrid plasmids was studied in purified Escherichia coli minicells. The type I dihydrofolate reductase, encoded by plasmid R483 and residing within transposon 7 (Tn7), had a subunit molecular weight of 18,000. The type II dihydrofolate reductase, specified by plasmid R67, had a subunit molecular weight of 9,000. These two enzymes were antigenically distinct in that anti-type II dihydrofolate reductase (R67) antibody did not cross-react with the type I (R483) protein. The trimethoprim-resistant reductase specified by plasmid R388 had a subunit molecular weight of about 10,500 and was immunologically related to the type II (R67) enzyme. A 9,000 subunit of the dihydrofolate encoded by the transposition element Tn402 was also antigenically related to the R67 reductase.'

aS'At various stages during spore formation sporangia were shocked by cold treatment or with toluene, and the germination requirements of the prespores were examined. Up to 5 h after induction of sporulation (t5) germination was spontaneous; i.e., it occurred without any added germinants. After t5, during stages V and VI, the capacity for spontaneous germination diminished progressively, and the spores acquired a need for externally added germinants. At t6 this need was satisfied by either L-alanine or a mixture of KCl, glucose, and fructose. By t8, the latter response had disappeared. The spores germinated only with L-alanine, and the response was much slower. Experiments with chloramphenicol showed that the germination properties of the spores appearing between t6 and t8 were the expression of events in protein synthesis that had occurred before t5. Although the germination requirements developed at about the same time as heat resistance, they could be dissociated from heat resistance in wild-type and mutant cells. The germination properties of the developing spores are additional marker events characterizing the later stages of sporulation, as follows: (i) spontaneous germination (up to the end of stage IV); (ii) germination requirements that are satisfied by KCl-glucose-fructose or L-alanine (stage V); and (iii) slow germination response with L-alanine only (stage VI).'

aS'During sporulation in replacement medium, resistance to toluene to heating at 65 degrees C, to lysozyme, and to heating at 80 degrees C appeared in sequence between 4 and 8 h after the induction of sporulation (i.e., between t4 and t8). The addition of sufficient chloramphenicol at t4.5 to prevent protein synthesis nevertheless allowed the emergence of all of these types of resistance except lysozyme resistance. The numbers of spores with these types of resistance (lysozyme resistance again excepted) increased about fourfold when phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (an inhibitor of serine protease activity) was also present. Thus, the observed increases in resistance in the 2 h after the addition of chloramphenicol resulted from the utilization of preformed protein elements. Dipicolinate did not seem to be a determining factor in the development of any of these forms of resistance. Electron micrographs showed that inhibition of protein synthesis did not prevent deposition of the outer layers of the spores. Lysozyme resistance developed differently; synthesis of the relevant proteins began later (t5), and continued synthesis was necessary up to t8. Some processing of proteins made earlier was a prerequisite for lysozyme resistance. Therefore, it appears that from the viewpoint of regulation, the expression of the genes and the production of the proteins for resistance to toluene, heating at 65 degrees C, and heating at 80 degrees C are all stage IV sporulation events, although the resistance properties themselves appear only during stages V and VI. Lysozyme resistance is the only real late event among those examined. The germination characteristics of the spores, which are also late events, are discussed in this context, as they too are dependent on proteins that are synthesized much earlier.'

aS'Strain D-3 was shown, by genetic complementation with lambda phage vectors carrying either the wild type or a temperature-sensitive allele, to contain an ftsA mutation. The presence of this mutation rendered the strain unable to divide at 42 degrees C. The action of the ftsA gene product in strain D-3 takes place at a late stage of the cycle, starting near the end of the replication cycle and extending until cell division is completed. The action of the ftsA gene product seemed to take a constant time, independent of the duration of the cell division cycle. Experiments in which all other requirements for division except a "termination protein" were completed show that cells of strain D-3 can divide under these conditions only at the permissive temperature. We conclude that a likely role for the ftsA gene product is that of a termination protein.'

aS'In rabbits immunized with intact bacteria, the immune response to the enterobacterial common antigen (ECA) predominantly consists of the production of immunoglobulin M antibodies. This is not dependent on whether the animals are immunized for a short (2 weeks) or a long (3 months) period of time. The highest ECA-specific immunoglobulin G titers were observed after a short immunization with living bacteria. ECA-specific antisera were obtained by absorption with appropriate ECA-negative mutants. The absorbed antisera were then separated on Sephadex G-200. The resulting immunoglobulin G fractions were conjugated to ferritin by glutardialdehyde and used to visualize the distribution of ECA in E. coli. Bacterial strains either possessing the immunogenic form of ECA (F470, 2387) or solely the nonimmunogenic form (F614) or being devoid of both (ECA-negative mutants F1283 and F1327) were labeled with the conjugates. Freezeetchings of ferritin-labeled strains showed a dense labeling of the outer membrane in case of ECA-immunogenic strains, an essentially weaker labeling of the non-immunogenic ECA mutant and, as expected, no labeling of ECA-negative mutants. Comparable results were obtained with the indirect immunofluorescence technique: the whole cell envelope of strain F470 showed a brilliant fluorescence, whereas a much lesser, spotty distribution of fluorescence was noted with strain F614 and none at all was noted with the ECA-negative strains. These data show that ECA is localized in the outer membrane of ECA-containing strains and further demonstrate that there is more in the immunogenic strains than in the nonimmunogenic ones.'

aS'The surface of several laboratory strains of Staphylococcus aureus were observed with a scanning electron microscope, and the presence of two morphologically characteristic structures--a ridge separating cell surface into old and new surfaces and a concentric circular structure--are described. These two structures seemed to be present universally on the surfaces of cells of the genus Staphylococcus. The removal of the circular structures by a mild treatment of the cell with trichloroacetic acid suggested that this structure seemed to represent circularly arranged teichoic acid. With experiments using morphologically recognizable markers among three of the cell wall components, clumping factor, phage receptor, and protein A, the clumping factor was proven to be specifically localized on the old surface; and more phage receptors were detected on the old surface than on the new surface, but protein A was present all over the cell surface. This indicated that the clumping factor and most of the phage receptors appeared on the cell wall surface in a late stage of the cell growth cycle, but protein A was present in an early stage of the growth.

aS'The surface structure and cell envelope layers of various virulent Bacteroides nodosus strains were examined by light microscopy and by electron microscopy by using negative staining, thin-section, and freeze-fracture-etch techniques. Three surface structures were described: pili and a diffuse material, both of which emerged from one or both poles of the bacteria (depending on the stage of growth and division), and large rodlike structures (usually 30 to 40 nm in diameter) associated with a small proportion of the bacterial population. No capsule was detected. The cell envelope consisted of four layers: a plasma membrane, a peptidoglycan layer, an outer membrane, and an outermost additional layer. The additional layer was composed of subunits, generally hexagonally packed with center-to-center spacing of 6 to 7 nm. The outer membrane and plasma membrane freeze-fractured through their hydrophobic regions revealing four fracture faces with features similar to those of other gram-negative bacteria. However, some unusual features were seen on the fracture faces of the outer membrane: large raised ring structure (11 to 12 nm in diameter) on cw 3 at the poles of the bacteria; complementary pits or ring-shaped depressions on cw 2; and small raised ring structures (7 to 8 nm in diameter) all over cw 2.'

aS'flu, a gene of Escherichia coli K-12, was discovered and mapped between his and shiA. It is shown that flu is a metastable gene that changes frequently between the flu+ and flu states. flu+ variants give stable homogeneous suspensions, are piliated, and form glossy colonies. flu variants aggregate, fluff and sediment from suspensions, are nonpiliated, and form frizzy colonies. flu+ and flu variants can be isolated from most strains. Implications of these observations are discussed, and it is demonstrated that flu+ variants of strain P678-54 yield three times more minicells than flu variants.'

aS'Amine and carboxyl groups of the cell wall of Bacillus subtilis were chemically modified individually to neutralize their electrochemical charge for determination of their contribution to the metal uptake process. Mild alkali treatment removed ca. 94% of the constituent teichoic acid (expressed as inorganic phosphorus) and allowed estimation of metal interaction with phosphodiester bonds. Chemical modifications of amine functions did not reduce the metal uptake values as compared to native walls, whereas extraction of teichoic acid caused a stoichiometric reduction in levels. In contrast, alteration of carboxyl groups severely limited metal deposition of most of the metals tested. X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy suggested, in this case, that the form and structure of the metal deposit could be different from that found in native walls. The observations suggest that carboxyl groups provide the major site of metal deposition in the B. subtilis wall.'

aS'The isolation procedure and characterization of the outer and inner membranes from Selenomonas ruminatium cells, a strictly anaerobic bacterium, are described. The metabolic fate of [14C]decanoate incorporated into the outer and inner membranes was examined. The percent distribution of radioactivities in the outer and inner membranes was about 40 and 50% of the total incorporated activity, respectively. Approximately 47% of the radioactivity incorporated into the outer membrane was recovered in the phospholipid fraction, and the remaining radioactivity was found in both aqueous and phenol layers when the outer membrane was treated with phenol-water. In contrast to [14C]decanoate, the percent distribution of [3H]glycerol in the outer and inner membranes was about 25 and 70% of the total incorporated activity, respectively. Most of the assimilated 3H was located in the phospholipid fraction of both membranes. However, no significant label was detected in either the protein or cell wall fraction. The following observations were made concerning lipid compositions in the outer and inner membranes by chemical and isotopic analyses. (i) The outer and inner membranes contained no detectable phosphatidyl glycerol or cardiolipin. (ii) A prominent radioactive compound, designated band III lipid, was found mainly in the outer membrane as a major radioactive spot when cells were grown with [14C]decanoate. This lipid contained phosphorus, 2-keto-3-deoxyoctulosonic acid and 3-OH fatty acid but no detectable glycerol. This lipid was identified tentatively to be 2-keto-3-deoxyoctulosonic acid-lipid A. (iii) Although the ubiquity of phosphatidyl ethanolamine plasmalogen in both outer and inner membranes was confirmed, the occurrence of the molecular species of phosphatidyl ethanolamine plasmalogen was quite different in the outer and inner membranes.'

aS'The protein compositions of the membrane preparations from Selenomonas ruminantium grown in glucose or lactate medium were determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate- and two-dimensional (first, isoelectric focusing; second, sodium dodecyl sulfate) polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis. The outer membrane from both glucose- and lactate-grown cells contained two major proteins with apparent molecular weights of 42,000 and 40,000. These proteins existed as peptidoglycan-associated proteins in the outer membrane. The critical temperature at which they were dissociated completely into the monomeric subunits of 42,000 and 40,000 daltons was found to be 85 degrees C. The amount of each protein varied considerably depending upon the cultural conditions. The absence of the lipoprotein of Braun in S. ruminantium was suggested in our preceding paper (Y. Kamio, and H. Takahashi, J. Bacteriol. 141:888--898, 1980), and the possible absence of the protein components corresponding to the Braun lipoprotein in this strain was confirmed by electrophoretic analysis of the outer membrane and the lysozyme-treated peptidoglycan fractions. Examination of the cell surface of S. ruminantium by electron microscopy showed that the outer membrane formed a wrinkled surface with irregular blebs, some of which pinched off forming vesicles of various sizes. Rapid cell lysis occurred with the addition of a low level of lysozyme to the cell suspension. These findings led us to conclude that the physiological and morphological properties of this strain were similar to those of "deep rough" and mlp or lpo mutants of Escherichia coli K-12, respectively.'

aS'Methylosinus trichosporium exospores did not display a well-defined cortex or an exosporium. A thick, electron-dense exospore wall was characteristic of the exospores. Located on the exterior of the exospore wall was a cell wall to which a well-defined capsule was attached. An extensive lamellar intracytoplasmic membrane system characteristic of the kind in vegetative cells of this bacterium was present along the interior periphery of the exospore wall. Upon germination of M. trichosporium exospores, the thick exospore wall gradually disappeared and a germ tube formed. The intracytoplasmic membranes of the exospores extended into the germ tube which did not possess the extensive fibrillar capsule observed on the dormant exospore. Cup-shaped exospores which have an ultrastructure similar to that of mature exospores except that they are invaginated also germinated upon exposure to methane.'

aS'We have developed methods for separating the cytoplasmic and outer membranes of vegetative cells of Myxococcus xanthus. The total membrane fraction from ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-lysozyme-treated cells was resolved into three major fractions by isopycnic density centrifugation. Between 85 and 90% of the succinate dehydrogenase and cyanide-sensitive reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide oxidase activity was found in the first (I) fraction (rho = 1.221 g/ml) and 80% of the membrane-associated 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate was found in the third (III) fraction (rho = 1.166 g/ml). The middle (II) fraction (rho = 1.185 g/ml) appeared to be a hybrid membrane fraction and contained roughly 10 to 20% of the activity of the enzyme markers and 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate. No significant amounts of deoxyribonucleic acid or ribonucleic acid were present in the three isolated fractions, although 26% of the total cellular deoxyribonucleic acid and 3% of the total ribonucleic acid were recovered with the total membrane fraction. Phosphatidylethanolamine made up the bulk (60 to 70%) of the phospholipids in the membrane fractions. However, virtually all of the phosphatidylserine and cardiolipin were found in fraction I. Fraction III appeared to contain elevated amounts of lysophospholipids and contained almost three times the amount of total phospholipid as compared with fraction I. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis resolved approximately 40 polypeptides in the total membrane fraction. Two-thirds of these polypeptides were enriched in fraction I, and the remainder was enriched in fraction III. Fraction II contained a banding pattern similar to the total membrane fraction. Electron microscopy revealed that vegetative cells of M. xanthus possessed an envelope similar to that of other gram-negative bacteria; however, the vesicular appearance of the isolated membranes was somewhat different from those reported for Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. The atypically low bouyant density of the outer membrane of M. xanthus is discussed with regard to the high phospholipid content of the outer membrane.'

aS'The structure of the nucleoid of Streptococcus faecalis (ATCC 9790) was examined and compared in the unfixed and fixed states by immersive refractometry and electron microscopy. It appears from these studies that the nucleoid structure is much more centralized in unfixed chloramphenicol-treated (stationary-phase) cells than it is in cells in the exponential phase of growth. The more dispersed configuration of the exponential-phase nucleoid could be preserved by fixation in glutaraldehyde, but not in Formalin or in osmium tetroxide. One important factor in explaining these differences in preservation is that glutaraldehyde (but not Formalin or osmium tetroxide) can rapidly cross-link the amino groups of macromolecules in cells. It was also observed that osmium tetroxide resulted in a preferential breakdown of nascent ribonucleic acid. These results are interpreted as indicating that glutaraldehyde is able to stabilize the exponential-phase nucleoid before it assumes the more central appearance seen in osmium tetroxide- and Formalin-fixed cells. These results are discussed in terms of the proposed organization of the exponential-phase nucleoid in unfixed cells.'

aS'Exposure of exponential-phase cultures of Streptococcus faecalis to any of three inhibitors of protein synthesis was accompanied by an increase in the average distance that the cross wall extended into the cytoplasm. This resulted in: (i) an increase in the average surface area of the cross wall (Sa) and (ii) septation occurring in the envelope growth sites that were much smaller than the controls. However, although at the concentrations used, all three antibiotics inhibited protein synthesis and autolytic capacity to the same extent and with the same kinetics, cells treated with these agents showed large differences in the rate at which Sa values increased above those of the untreated cells. The largest increases in Sa were observed in cells that synthesized the least amount of cytoplasmic macromolecules (deoxyribonucleic acid, plus ribonucleic acid, plus protein). The observations were interpreted in terms of a model in which a decreased lytic capacity reduces the rate of splitting of the nascent cross wall into two layers of peripheral wall, preferentially using wall precursors to close open cross walls. However, the extent to which centripetal growth occurs would be inversely related to the rate at which cytoplasmic macromolecules are synthesized. In contrast, inhibition of deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis was accompanied by decreased extension of the leading edge of the cross wall into the cytoplasm, thus antagonizing septation. These findings are discussed in relation to the normal cell division cycle of S. faecalis.'

aS'An electron microscope cytochemical technique was used to determine the subcellular distribution of marker enzymes in Fusidium sp. 100-3 cells. Nucleoside diphosphatase was found in the nuclear envelope and intracytoplasmic membrane segment. Thiamine pyrophosphatase was found to be associated with the mesosomes. Cytochrome c (oxidase) activity was found only in the mitochondrial cristae. Strong alkaline phosphatase activity was present in the vacuole; in addition, the enzyme activity was discretely dispersed throughout the cytoplasm without any association with any membrane material. The overall characteristics of the cell ultrastructure and subcellular enzyme distribution of Fusidium sp. 100-3 cells compare fairly well with those of a fungal cell. But there are considerable differences from the characteristics of higher eucaryotic cells. Detailed data on the marker enzymes distribution in a variety of fungal cells are not available. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether the marker enzyme distribution of Fusidium sp. 100-3 cells is unique or is typical of any fungal organism. Detailed studies of cell ultrastructure of and marker enzyme distribution in minute fungal cells and their comparison to the ultrastructure of and marker enzyme distribution in other fungal organisms may be helpful in understanding the phylogenetic and ontogenic development of subcellular organelles.'

aS'Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) binding factor (BF) was found in surface fluids from competent and noncompetent cells of Streptococcus sanguis strains Challis, Wicky, and Blackburn. Fluids from noncompetent cells exhibited about 10% BF activity compared with extracts from competent cells. BF from competent Wicky cells was purified to homogeneity by electrophoresis and immunodiffusion. Purified BF preparations exhibited slight endonucleolytic activity, directed mainly against single-stranded DNA. Nucleolytic and DNA binding activities present in purified BF could be separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Purified BF was sensitive to proteolytic enzymes and to phospholipase D, and its activity was stimulated in the presence of low Triton X-100 concentrations. The protein component of BF is a single, monomeric polypeptide with a molecular weight of 56,000 and an isoelectric point of pH 5.8. Binding of purified BF to DNA was a very rapid process at the optimum temperature, pH, and ionic strength and led to the formation of fast-sedimenting complexes. Purified BF was tested for several properties. It exhibited higher affinity to single- than to double-stranded DNA. It bound poorly to glucosylated phage T4 and single-stranded, synthetic polydeoxyribonucleotides and did not bind to RNA. It protected single-stranded DNA against nuclease S(1) action but did not protect native DNA against deoxyribonuclease I action. No evidence was found for unwinding activity, using double-stranded DNA as a substrate.'

aS'Plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) isolated from each of three antibiotic-resistant clinical strains of Escherichia coli producing the same microcin showed multiple bands upon agarose gel electrophoresis. Transformants selected either for microcin resistance or ampicillin resistance yielded plasmid DNA corresponding in size to only one of the multiple bands. Plasmids, isolated from all three hosts, which determined microcin resistance and microcin production measured about 4 megadaltons by sucrose density, restriction enzyme, and contour length analyses; cleavage of the DNAs by each of eight restriction enzymes showed the same response, and DNA-DNA hybridization indicated complete homology. The antibiotic resistance plasmids of the three host strains were uniformly larger, were of different sizes, and showed different restriction enzyme cleavage patterns. One of these R plasmids (pCP106) also determined the synthesis of the same microcin, and DNA-DNA hybridization studies indicated an approximate 2.4-megadalton homology with the 4-megadalton microcin plasmid pCP101. The microcin plasmids were present at approximately 20 copies per genome equivalent and were nonconjugative, whereas the R plasmids had a copy number of about 1, were conjugative, and could mobilize the microcin plasmid. Microcin plasmid pCP101 showed replication properties similar to those of a number of small multicopy plasmids such as ColE1.'

aS'The replication of ColE1 deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) took place at the restrictive temperature in a dnaA mutant, dnaA167(Ts). It proceeded at a constant rate at 42 degrees C for at least 3 h. The replication was insensitive to rifampin, which blocked replication at the permissive temperature or in the presence of chloramphenicol, even at the restrictive temperature. A linear DNA strand of ColE1 longer than unit genome size was synthesized. The structure of the replicating molecules observed by electron microscopy was mostly sigma shaped, composed of a circle of a unit genome length with a double-stranded tail. These observations suggest that the replication of ColE1 DNA proceeds via a rolling-circle type of structure in the absence of dnaA function.'

aS'Transport of [3H]melibiose, prepared from [3H]raffinose, was investigated in Escherichia coli. Na+ stimulated the transport of melibiose via the melibiose system, whereas Li+ inhibited it. Kinetic parameters of melibiose transport were determined. The Kt values were 0.57 mM in the absence of Na+ or Li+, 0.27 mM in the presence of 10 mM NaCl, and 0.29 mM in the presence of 10 mM LiCl. The Vmax values were 40 and 46 nmol/min per mg of protein in the absence and in the presence of NaCl and 18 nmol/min per mg of protein in the presence of LiCl. Melibiose transport via the melibiose system was temperature sensitive in a wild-type strain of Escherichia coli and was not inhibited by lactose. On the other hand, melibiose uptake via the lactose system was not temperature sensitive, was inhibited by lactose, and was not affected by Na+ and Li+. Methyl-beta-D-thiogalactoside, a substrate for both systems, inhibited the transport of melibiose via both systems.'

aS'Preincubation of the blue-green alga (cyanobacterium) Nostoc muscorum under an atmosphere of argon plus acetylene in the light led to a greater than fourfold increase of light-induced hydrogen evolution and to a 50% increase of acetylene reduction, as compared to cells that had not been preconditioned. The basic and the increased hydrogen evolution were both due to nitrogenase activity. Furthermore, after preincubation the hydrogen uptake, usually observed with unconditional cells, was abolished. Nostoc preincubated under acetylene evolved hydrogen in the light even in the presence of nitrogen for at least 2 h, with a 15-fold increase as compared to the unconditioned cells. These acetylene effects could be completely abolished by the presence of hydrogen during acetylene preincubation. These findings indicate that the hydrogen concentration in N. muscorum cells plays a role in regulation of nitrogenase activity.'

aS'In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the specific activity of the enzyme ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) was correlated with overall growth status. The activity of ODC was highest in actively growing cells, whereas the specific activity was lower in slow-growing cultures limited for nitrogen or inhibited by low concentrations of cycloheximide. Specific activities of ODC were also low in cultures arrested in the stationary phase (in the G1 portion of the cell cycle) by starvation for required nutrients. Although correlated with overall growth, ODC activity was not required for growth or cell cycle regulation. Cells continued to grow in the presence of the polyamine spermidine or spermine, which markedly reduced ODC specific activities. Thus, high levels of ODC activity were not necessary for growth, nor were decreased ODC specific activities sufficient to cause cells to arrest in G1. Conversely, one agent (o-phenanthroline) which causes growing cells to arrest in G1 did so with no effect on ODC specific activity. Therefore, ODC specific activity changes are not necessary for cell cycle regulation but simply reflect the normal growth status of cells.'

aS'The composition of the molecular species of acidic phospholipids in Escherichia coli B during the late exponential growth phase at 37 degrees C was determined. Two phosphatidyl groups of cardiolipin, the 3-(3-sn-phosphatidyl) and 1-(3-sn-phosphatidyl) moieties of cardiolipin, were isolated by limited hydrolysis with phospholipase C. No significant difference in the composition of the molecular species was found between the 3-(3-sn-phosphatidyl) and 1-(3-sn-phosphatidyl) moieties. On the other hand, the composition of the molecular species of phosphatidylglycerol was different from that of cardiolipin. Phosphatidylglycerol contained more of the 1-palmitoyl 2-cis-9,10-methylenehexadecanoyl and 1-palmitoyl 2-cis-11,12-methyleneoctadecanoyl species than did cardiolipin. The difference in the composition of the molecular species between cardiolipin and phosphatidylglycerol may depend on the difference in the turnover rates of both phospholipids.'

aS'A binding protein for branched-chain amino acids was purified to a homogeneous state from shock fluid of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PML14. It was a monomeric protein with an apparent molecular weight of 4.3 x 10(4) or 4.0 x 10(4) by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or gel filtration, respectively. The isoelectric point was determined to be pH 4.1 by electrofocusing. Amino acid analysis of the protein showed that aspartic acid, glutamic acid, glycine, and alanine were major components and that the protein contained only one residue each of tryptophan and cysteine per molecule. The binding protein contained no sugar. The binding activity of the protein was specific for the branched-chain amino acids. The protein also bound alanine and threonine with lower affinity. The dissociation constants of this protein for leucine, isoleucine, and valine were found to be 0.4, 0.3, and 0.5 microM, respectively. Mutants defective in the production of the binding protein were identified among the mutants deficient in a transport system for branched-chain amino acids (LIV-I). The revertants from these mutants to LIV-I-positive phenotype simultaneously recovered normal levels of the binding protein. These findings suggest strongly the association of the binding protein with the LIV-I transport system.'

aS'Glycerol:oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) 2-oxidoreductase (EC 1.1.1.6), an inducible enzyme for anaerobic glycerol catabolism in Klebsiella aerogenes, was purified and found to have a molecular weight of 79,000 by gel electrophoresis. The protein seemed to be enzymatically active either as a dimer of a 40,000-dalton peptide at pH 8.6 or as a tetramer of 160,000 molecular weight at pH 7.0. The enzyme activity was present at high levels in cells growing anaerobically on glycerol, but disappeared with a half-life of about 45 min if molecular oxygen was introduced to the culture. In contrast, no such phenomenon occurred with dihydroxyacetone kinase activity, the second enzyme in the pathway. Immunochemical analysis showed that the inactivation of the oxidoreductase did not involve degradation of the protein. Furthermore, subunits of the active and inactive forms of the enzyme were indistinguishable in size on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and had similar isoelectric points (pH 4.7). Inactivation did, however, alter the gel filtration properties of the enzyme protein and, more importantly, reduced its affinity for the dye Cibacron F3GA and the coenzyme NAD+.'

aS'A method is described for isolating cytoplasmic mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae with lesions in mitochondrial transfer ribonucleic acids (tRNA\'s). The mutants were selected for slow growth on glycerol and for restoration of wild-type growth by cytoplasmic "petite" testers that contain regions of mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) with tRNA genes. The aminoacylated mitochondrial tRNA\'s of several presumptive tRNA mutants were analyzed by reverse-phase chromatography on RPC-5. Two mutant strains, G76-26 and G76-35, were determined to carry mutations in the cysteine and histidine tRNA genes, respectively. The cysteine tRNA mutant was used to isolate cytoplasmic petite mutants whose retained segments of mitochondrial DNA contain the cysteine tRNA gene. The segment of one such mutant (DS504) was sequenced and shown to have the cysteine, histidine, and threonine tRNA genes. The structures of the three mitochondrial tRNA\'s were deduced from the DNA sequence.'

aS"The amounts of ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase (beta' subunits) and ribosomes (RNA), and the fraction of RNA polymerase actively engaged in transcription, were measured in Escherichia coli B/r as a function of growth rate. By an improved method of quantitating protein bands on electrophoresis gels, the systematic error and reproducibility of the RNA polymerase determination were estimated to be less than 15 and 6%, respectively. For a threefold increase in growth rate, the fractional synthesis of polymerase (relative to protein) increased 1.5-fold, whereas the fractional synthesis of ribosomal protein increased 2.2-fold. The decrease in the amount of RNA polymerase per ribosome with increasing growth rate is interpreted as an expression of the control of the transcriptional read-through from the genes for ribosomal protein, rplJ,L, to the adjacent genes for RNA polymerase subunits, rpoB,C. The number of active RNA polymerase molecules was determined from the synthesis rates of stable and messenger RNA and the known RNA chain growth rates. Comparison of active and total RNA polymerase indicates that the fraction of active enzyme increases from 20 to 30% in the range of growth rates between 0.6 and 2.0 doublings per hour. Possible causes for the inactive enzyme are discussed."

aS'In Rhizobium trifolii 7000, the polyols myo-inositol, xylitol, ribitol, D-arabitol, D-mannitol, D-sorbital, and dulcitol are metabolized by inducible nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent polyol dehydrogenases. Five different polyol dehydrogenases were recognized: inositol dehydrogenase, specific for inositil; ribitol dehydrogenase, specific for ribitol; D-arabitol dehydrogenase, which oxidized D-arabitol, D-mannitol, and D-sorbitol; xylitol dehydrogenase, which oxidized xylitol and D-sorbitol; and dulcitol dehydrogenase, which oxidized dulcitol, ribitol, xylitol, and sorbitol. Apart from inositil and xylitol, all of the polyols induced more than one polyol dehydrogenase and polyol transport system, but the heterologous polyol dehydrogenases and polyol transport systems were not coordinately induced by a particular polyol. With the exception of xylitol, all of the polyols tested served as growth substrates. A mutant of trifolii 7000, which was constitutive for dulcitol dehydrogenase, could also grow on xylitol.'

aS'Mutants doubly deficient in phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (pck) and phosphoenolpyruvate synthetase (pps) were unable to grow with succinate as the sole carbon source. A number of pck mutations isolated from pps strains by penicillin selection mapped at 74 min on the Escherichia coli chromosome, between glpD and aroB. Several of the strains containing these mutations had a protein antigenically related to phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, and therefore, the mutations probably represented mutations in the structural gene for this enzyme. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase was regulated at the level of transcription by catabolite repression. Enzyme levels also increased in stationary-phase cultures by a mechanism independent of cyclic adenosine monophosphate or the product of the relA gene.'

This concentration of the saturated fatty acids palmitic acid and stearic acid had little or no effect on the growth of whole cells or protoplasts. However, the unsaturated fatty acids oleic acid and linoleic acid induced lysis in both situations. This lytic effect is apparently not related to any uncoupling activity or inhibition of energy catabolism by unsaturated fatty acids. It is concluded that unsaturated fatty acids induce cell and protoplast lysis by acting as more potent membrane destabilizers than saturated fatty acids.'

aS'A total of 20 laboratory substrains of Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain B6 were compared with respect to six characteristics, including 3-ketolactose production, lysogeny, octopine catabolism, tumorigenic host range, and plasmid content. Within this group of strains diversity was found for all characteristics except 3-ketolactose production. Six substrains were lysogenized with an omega-type phage, whereas one substrain appeared neither sensitive to nor lysogenized with this bacteriophage. All but two substrains catabolized octopine and induced tumors on carrot disks. These 18 substrains harbor deoxyribonucleic acid sequences homologous to pTiB6-806. The two substrains unable to catabolize octopine were nontumorigenic and lacked detectable Ti plasmid sequences. Of the 20 substrains, 13 also contained sequences homologous to the cryptic plasmid pAtB6-806; 2 of the 18 substrains tumorigenic on carrots failed to induce tumors on Kalanchoe leaves. Their inability to induced tumors on this host, could not be correlated with lysogeny, with the presence or absence of pAtB6-806, or with the very large cryptic plasmid recently described. The Ti plasmids from these two strains were indistinguishable from pTiB6-806 by restriction enzyme analysis and could genetically convert a cured A. tumefaciens strain to tumorigenicity on both plant species. The results with these two strains suggest that parameters of tumorigenicity, such as host range, may be controlled by the bacterial chromosome.'

aS'Agrobacterium rhizogenes strain 15834, which incites hairy root disease in plants, harbors three large plasmids: pAr15834a (107 x 10(6) daltons), pAr15834b (154 x 10(6) daltons), and pAr15834c (258 x 10(6) daltons). Kanamycin-resistant transconjugants were selected in a cross of kanamycin-resistant derivate of strain 15834 and an avirulent recipient. The transconjugants belonging to one class were virulent and contained all three donor plasmids. These transconjugants also acquired sensitivity to the bacteriocin agrocin 84. The loss of plasmids from virulent transconjugants during growth at 37 degrees C indicated that virulence genes reside on pAr15834b, whereas agrocin 84 sensitivity genes reside on pAr15834a. The pathology induced by the virulent transconjugants containing only pAr15834b was identical to that produced by the wild-type strain of A. rhizogenes. Restriction endonuclease fragment analysis of plasmids from the transconjugants and the donor revealed that pAr15834c is a cointegrate of pAr15834a and pAr15834b. Kanamycin-resistant transconjugants belonging to a second class were avirulent and contained an altered form of pAr15834b. Strain 15834 can utilize octopine. However, this trait was not detected in any of the transconjugants. Octopine is not synthesized by infected plant tissue.'

aS'Crude messenger ribonucleic acid fractions isolated from Corynebacterium diphtheriae and Escherichia coli were translated in an E. coli in vitro protein-synthesizing system and yielded precursors of the secreted proteins diphtheria toxin and alkaline phosphatase, respectively. Addition of inverted E. coli inner membrane vesicles to the system during the initial stages of translation resulted in the intravesicular segregation of mature diphtheria toxin and alkaline phosphatase. Outer membrane vesicles or inner membrane vesicles whose cytoplasmic surfaces had been treated with pronase could not mediate transmembrane transfer of diphtheria toxin or alkaline phosphatase. However, inner membrane vesicles isolated from E. coli spheroplasts which had been treated with pronase and inner membrane vesicles complexed with ribosomes during pronase treatment were functional in transmembrane transfer. At temperatures below the phase transition of E. coli membranes, no intravesicular segregation of alkaline phosphatase or diphtheria toxin was observed. The precursor forms of each protein accumulated free from the vesicles. These results suggest that an inner membrane protein, exposed on the cytoplasmic surface, plays an integral role in secretion.'

aS'Cell division properties of Escherichia coli B/r containing either a dnaC or a dnaI mutation were examined. Incubation at nonpermissive temperature resulted in the eventual production of cells of approximately normal size, or slightly smaller, which lacked chromosomal DNA. The cell division patterns in cultures which were grown at permissive temperature and then shifted to nonpermissive temperature were consistent with: first, division and equipartition of chromosomes by cells which were in the C and D periods at the time of the shift; second, an apparent delay in cell division; and third, commencement of the formation of chromosomeless cells. In glucose-grown cultures of the dnaI mutant, production of chromosomeless cells continued for at least 120 min, whereas in the dnaC mutant chromosomeless cells were formed during a single interval between 110 and 130 min after the temperature shift. The results are discussed in light of the hypothesis that replication of a specific chromosomal region is not an obligatory requirement for the initiation and completion of the processes leading to division in a cell which contains at least one functioning chromosome.'

aS'A mutant strain of Klebsiella aerogenes was constructed and, when incubated anaerobically with L-fucose and glycerol, synthesized and excreted a novel methyl pentitol, 6-deoxy L-talitol. The mutant was constitutive for the synthesis of L-fucose isomerase but unable to synthesize L-fuculokinase activity. Thus, it could convert the L-fucose to L-fuculose but was incapable of phosphorylating L-fuculose to L-fuculose 1-phosphate. The mutant was also constitutive for the synthesis of ribitol dehydrogenase, and in the presence of sufficient reducing power this latter enzyme catalyzed the reduction of the L-fuculose to 6-deoxy L-talitol. The reducing equivalents required for this reaction were generated by the oxidation of glycerol to dihydroxyacetone with an anaerobic glycerol dehydrogenase. The parent strain of K. aerogenes was unable to utilize the purified 6-deoxy L-talitol as a sole source of carbon and energy for growth; however, mutant could be isolated which had gained this ability. Such mutants were found to be constitutive for the synthesis of ribitol dehydrogenase and were thus capable of oxidizing 6-deoxy L-talitol to L-fuculose. Further metabolism of L-fuculose was shown by mutant analysis to be mediated by the enzymes of the L-fucose catabolic pathway.'

aS'The rate of formation of seryl-transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) synthetase activity was temperature dependent in a temperature-sensitive mutant of Escherichia coli (K28) with an altered seryl-tRNA synthetase structural gene and in a class of spontaneous revertants derived from it. These revertants, which were selected by their ability to grow at 45 degrees C, had high levels of the thermolabile enzyme. The rate of formation of seryl-tRNA synthetase activity in the mutant and in the revertants fell from 100% to near zero with a 4 degrees C temperature range from 40 to 44 degrees C. The temperature-dependent rate of formation of seryl-tRNA synthetase activity was reversible. Dropping the temperature from 44 to 37 degrees C resulted, after a 2- to 3-min delay, in a resumption of the initial rate of formation of enzyme activity. The results could not be accounted for by in vivo or in vitro degradation of the active enzyme. Addition of rifampin just before the temperature shift down from 44 to 37 degrees C inhibited the appearance of seryl-tRNA synthetase activity at the lower temperature. Explanations which might account for these phenomena are proposed.'

aS'Antibodies were raised against Saccharomyces cerevisiae a-cells that had been exposed to the sex pheromone, alpha-factor. After adsorption of the antiserum with diploid cells, antibodies remained that reacted specifically with the mannan from haploid cells. The characteristic determinant was observed in mannan from pheromone-treated a-cells, in mannan from untreated alpha-cells, and at a much lower concentration, in mannan from control a-cells. The antigens from these three mannans appeared to be identical. The determinant was destroyed by mild-acid hydrolysis or periodate oxidation, but not by proteolysis or digestion with exo-alpha-mannanase. Mutants with altered mannan were unable to express the antigen. Complete acid hydrolysates mannan from alpha-factor-treated a-cells contained mannose, glucose, and N-acetylglucosamine. Partial acid hydrolysis, under conditions that destroyed the antigenic determinant, released only mannose and mannobiose. The mannose fraction was labeled to high specific activity during response of a-cells to alpha-factor if radioactive glucose was the carbon source. Neither alpha- not beta-D-mannopyranosyl phosphate was a hapten. The results are consistent with the presence of a haploid-specific antigen containing an acid-labile mannose determinant and show that the amount of this antigen in a-cell mannan is increased in response to alpha-factor.'

aS'The nucleotidyltransferase encoded by plasmid pUB110 was purified to greater than 95% purity with a 33% yield. The enzyme is a monomeric protein with a molecular weight of 34,000. The optimum pH for activity is 5, and the optimum MgCl2 concentration for activity is 18 mM. The enzyme, which is synthesized constitutively, is stable for several weeks at 4 degrees C. This enzyme would appear to be a good model gene product for the development of a pUB110 deoxyribonucleic acid-dependent in vitro protein-synthesizing system from Bacillus subtilis.'

aS"The proteins of the outer membrane of Neisseria gonorrhoeae play an important role in the serotyping system defined by K. H. Johnston et al. (J. Exp. Med. 143:741-758, 1976). This study attempted to delineate the molecular arrangement of the major proteins of the outer membrane of the gonococcus by using three approaches. First, natural protein-protein relationships were demonstrated by symmetrical, two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Second, proteins exposed on the surface of outer membrane vesicles were cross-linked by using the bifunctional reagents dimethyl-3,3'-dithiobispropionimidate and dithiobis[succinimidyl propionate]. Third, specific antigen-antibody interactions on the surface of membrane vesicles were analyzed by radioautographic techniques. The major proteins of the outer membrane of the gonococcus were defined, and a nomenclature was devised to take into account the effects of heat and reducing agents on the resolution of these proteins by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Results of cross-linking experiments strongly suggest that two of the major proteins of the gonococcal outer membrane (proteins 1 and 3) form a hydrophobically associated trimeric unit in situ which can be stabilized by selective cross-linking reagents. Results substantiated that these proteins are responsible for imparting serotypic specificity."

aS'We examined the rate of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) replication fork movement in polyamine-deficient cells of Escherichia coli by two independent techniques. DNA autoradiography was used to directly visualize the length of DNA produced during a given time interval, and replication rates were calculated. The amount of DNA synthesized after blocking protein synthesis also allowed calculation of replication rates. We found that the DNA chain elongation rate in polyamine-deficient cells was about half that of putrescine- or spermidine-supplemented cells. We also found that spermidine homologs of increasing chain length, when present at equal intracellular concentrations, exhibited a decreasing ability to support growth and the rate of DNA replication fork movement. The kinetics of recovery of DNA synthesis from the polyamine-deficient state were also investigated. A new rate of DNA synthesis was reached about 20 min after addition of spermidine to polyamine-limited cells. The rise in the rate of DNA synthesis was preceded by a rise in the intracellular concentration of spermidine.'

aS'The rate of turnover of peptidoglycan in exponentially growing cultures of Bacillus subtilis was observed to be sensitive to extracellular protease. In protease-deficient mutants the rates of cell wall turnover were greater than that of wild-type strain 168, whereas hyperprotease-producing strains exhibited decreased rates of peptidoglycan turnover. The rate of peptidogylcan turnover in a protease-deficient strain was decreased when the mutant was grown in the presence of a hyperprotease-producing strain. The addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, a serine protease inhibitor, to cultures of hyperprotease-producing strains increased their rates of cell wall turnover. Isolated cell walls of all protease mutants contained autolysin levels equal to or greater than that of wild-type strain 168. The presence of filaments, or cells with incomplete septa, was observed in hyperprotease-producing strains or when a protease-deficient strain was grown in the presence of subtilisin. The results suggest that the turnover of cell walls in B. subtilis may be regulated by extracellular proteases.'

aS'The two glutamine synthetases of Rhizobium sp. 32H1 appear to be structurally and functionally distinct. Glutamine synthetase I was reversibly adenylylated, and its synthesis was repressed only twofold by ammonium. When in the unadenylylated configuration, it was the enzyme which allowed the organism to grow, albeit marginally, on ammonium as a nitrogen source. There is no evidence to suggest that the second enzyme, glutamine synthetase II, is regulated by adenylylation. However, this enzyme was repressed at least 50-fold by even low amounts of ammonium. Glutamine synthetase II does not seem to function in ammonium assimilation but rather in purine biosynthesis.'

aS"Mutants of Mycobacterium smegmatis were selected for resistance to ethionine in an effort to obtain methylation-defective strains that were altered in their ability to make methylmannose polysaccharides (MMP) or methylglucose lipopolysaccharides. Two methods were developed for the detection of MMP in cell extracts to aid in the screening for potential mutants, one a qualitative procedure based on iodine binding by the sample after paper chromatography and the other a quantitative procedure based on fluorimetric titration of the MMP with parinaric acid. An ethionine-resistant mutant was obtained that contained only about 25% of the normal level of S-adenosylmethionine and 10% of the normal level of methionine adenosyltransferase (adenosine 5'-triphosphate:L-methionine S-adenosyltransferase, EC 2.5.1.6) activity. When grown in the presence of 0.1% ethionine, the mutant cells contained about 50% of the wild-type levels of methylglucose lipopolysaccharides but only about 7% of the normal level of MMP (wild-type cells contain about 0.14 mM MMP and the mutant contains about 0.01 mM MMP). The amount of fatty acid synthesis in the ethionine-resistant mutant grown in the presence of ethionine was not dramatically altered although the mutant accumulated more short-chain and less long-chain unsaturated fatty acids than the wild-type cells."

aS"A genetic map was prepared for gnd, the gene of Escherichia coli which encodes the metabolically regulated 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. Direct selection methods were used for the isolation of mutants with deletions that define the respective ends of gnd. These selections depended on the availability of a defective lysogen in which gnd was present on a lambda h80 dgnd his prophage located at the att phi 80 region of the chromosome. Mutants with deletions entering gnd from the his-distal end were selected as Gnd- TonB- mutants. Mutants with his-proximal gnd deletions were selected as Gnd-, temperature-resistant mutants of a specially prepared stable lysogen. Gnd- mutants were also isolated after mutagenesis with bacteriophage Mu cts61, and genetic tests were used to determine which mutants carry a Mu cts61 prophage in gnd. The deletion mutations were mapped against each other and against the insertion mutations through the use of F' merodiploid strains. The insertion mutations mapped at seven distinct sites in gnd; three mapped under the deletions defining the his-proximal portion of the gene and three mapped with the his-distal deletions."

aS'We measured some of the kinetic parameters of nitrogenase to intact systems of Clostridium pasteurianum and Klebsiella pneumoniae to compare them with the kinetics of the enzyme in vitro. We found that the enzyme showed multiple apparent Km values for acetylene reduction in vivo, as it does in vitro. Carbon monoxide was a noncompetitive inhibitor of acetylene reduction; azide was a noncompetitive inhibitor of acetylene reduction, and nitrogen was a partial inhibitor of acetylene reduction. Cyanide was a noncompetitive inhibitor of acetylene reduction in C. pasteurianum but it was a metabolic poison in K. pneumoniae, in addition to being an inhibitor of nitrogenase. The partial nature of nitrogen inhibition was apparent in assays where both nitrogen and CO were present. Nitrogen did not alter the apparent Ki for CO, nor did the presence of CO enhance the competitive effectiveness of nitrogen. By using recombined nitrogenase fractions, we found that the ability of nitrogen to inhibit hydrogen evolution or acetylene reduction varied with the ratio of protein components. The in vivo inhibition of acetylene reduction by dinitrogen was comparable to that obtained with an excess of the Fe protein in vitro. We conclude that there is an effective excess of the Fe protein available under active growth conditions in vivo.'

aS"Fifteen aminoacyl-transfer ribonucleic acids (tRNA's) from vegetative cells (trophozoites) and mature cysts of Acanthamoeba castellanii were compared by reversed-phase 5 chromatography. Little or no differences were detected in reversed-phase 5 chromatography elution profiles of alanyl-, arginyl-, isoleucyl-, phenylalanyl-, prolyl-, seryl-, threonyl-, tryptophanyl- and valyl-tRNA's. Significant differences in the relative proportions of isoaccepting species of leucyl-, lysyl-, methionyl-, aspartyl-, histidyl-, and tyrosyl-tRNA's were observed. Based upon the criterion of cyanogen bromide reactivity with the modified nucleoside queuosine, the content of queuosine in aspartyl-tRNA of A, castellanii is significantly greater in mature cysts than in trophozoites. The similarity of change in reversed-phase 5 chromatography elution profiles of aspartyl-, histidyl-, and tyrosyl-tRNA suggests that a common mechanism is responsible for alterations in the chromatographic patterns."

aS'Thermoanaerobium brockii was shown to catabolize glucose via the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway into ethanol, acetic acid, H(2)-CO(2), and lactic acid. Radioactive tracer studies, employing specifically labeled [(14)C]glucose, demonstrated significant fermentation of (14)CO(2) from C-3 and C-4 of the substrate exclusively. All extracts contained sufficient levels of activity (expressed in micromoles per minute per milligram of protein at 40 degrees C) to assign a catabolic role for the following enzymes: glucokinase, 0.40; fructose-1,6-diphosphate aldolase, 0.23; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 1.73; pyruvate kinase, 0.36; lactate dehydrogenase (fructose-1,6-diphosphate activated), 0.55; pyruvate dehydrogenase (coenzyme A acetylating), 0.53; hydrogenase, 3.3; phosphotransacetylase, 0.55; acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (coenzyme A acetylating), 0.15; ethanol dehydrogenase, 1.57; and acetate kinase, 1.50. All pyridine nucleotide-linked oxidoreductases examined were specific for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, except ethanol dehydrogenase which displayed both nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide- and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-linked activities. Fermentation product balances and cell growth yields supported the glucose catabolic pathway described. Representative balanced end product yields (in moles per mole of glucose fermented) were: ethanol, 0.94; l-lactate, 0.84; acetate, 0.20; CO(2), 1.31; and H(2), 0.50. Growth yields of 16.4 g of cells per mole of glucose were demonstrated. Both growth and end product yields varied significantly in accordance with the specific medium composition and incubation time.'

aS'An analysis of transposon-induced mutants shows that Salmonella typhimurium possesses two major isozymes of acetohydroxy acid synthase, the enzymes which mediate the first common step in isoleucine and valine biosynthesis. A third (minor) acetohydroxy acid synthase is present, but its significance in isoleucine and valine synthesis may be negligible. Mutants defective in acetohydroxy acid synthase II (ilvG::Tn10) require isoleucine, alpha-ketobutyrate, or threonine for growth, a mutant defective in acetohydroxy acid synthase I (ilvB::Tn5) is a prototroph, and a double mutant (ilvG::Tn10 ilvB::Tn5) requires isoleucine plus valine for growth.'

aS'Seve lambda dnif specialized transducing bacteriophages were isolated from Escherichia coli strains containing plasmids carrying the his-nif region of Klebsiella pneumoniae. These phages collectively carry deoxyribonucleic acid for all of the genes in the nif regulon and adjacent deoxyribonucleic acid of K. pneumoniae. The phages were isolated by using Mu insertions in the nif region to direct the integration of lambda pMu phages in nif via formation of lambda pMu-Mu dilysogens which, upon induction, yielded lambda dnif phages. This procedure should be generally applicable for isolating lambda specialized transducing phages carrying genes from E. coli or other bacteria.'

The principal compound is a decapreno carotenoid (C50H72O2) tentatively characterized as 2,2'-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methyl-2-butenyl)-gamma,gamma-carotene on the basis of electronic absorption, infrared, proton magnetic resonance, and mass spectrometries. The carotenoid is presumed to be identical to sarcinaxanthin from Sarcina lutea pro-synon. Micrococcus luteus and, therefore, is isomeric with decaprenoxanthin from Cellulomonas dehydrogenans."

aS'The catabolite activator protein was assayed in extracts from the minicell-producing Escherichia coli strain P678-54. The level of catabolite activator protein was found to be the same in both parent cells and purified minicells, regardless of whether the bacteria were grown on glucose (which leads to low intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels) or on glycerol-yeast extract or LB broth (which lead to high cyclic adenosine monophosphate concentrations in the cell). Thus, at any given time most catabolite activator protein molecules are found in the cytoplasm. The implications of this for the mechanism of catabolite activator protein action at catabolite-sensitive operons are discussed.'

aS'We analyzed a series of germ tube-negative variants isolated from Candida albicans 3153A for deoxyribonucleic acid content. As analyzed by flow microfluorometry, the deoxyribonucleic acid level in these variant strains was 50% of that of the parental strain and equivalent to that of haploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This finding was confirmed by comparison of survival rates when exposed to the mutagens ultraviolet light, ethyl methane sulfonate, and methyl methane sulfonate. The diameter of the variant cells as compared to the diameter of the parental 3153A strain showed a relationship similar to that of the diameters of haploid versus diploid S. cerevisiae. These results indicate that those strains may be representative of the imperfect stage of C. albicans.'

Therefore, the enzyme functions in the biosynthesis of the beta-alanine moiety of pantothenate. The genetic lesion in these mutants is closely linked to the other pantothenate (pan) loci of E. coli K-12.'

aS'Streptococcus pneumoniae R6X was lysogenized with bacteriophage 304 isolated after mitomycin induction of an ungrouped alpha-hemolytic streptococcus. Lysogenized pneumococci lost their capacity to undergo genetic transformation: transformability was restored after cells were spontaneously cured of their prophage. Both lysogens and nonlysogens produced activator substance (competence factor), and both bound deoxyribonucleic acid in a deoxyribonuclease-resistant form. However, nonlysogens retained deoxyribonucleic acid after washing, whereas lysogens did not. The latter did not liberate phage nor (unlike nonlysogens) degrade transforming deoxyribonucleic acid and contained normal levels of endonuclease.'

aS'Thirty-two independent mutants were isolated which overcame the proline requirement of pro-3 mutations in Neurospora crassa. The mutations were not revertants, appeared to be allelic, were closely linked or allelic to arg-6, and in strains unable to degrade ornithine no longer suppressed the proline requirement. The suppressor mutations did not alter the levels of biosynthetic or catabolic enzymes, yet allowed accumulation of ornithine. Suppressed strains unable to degrade arginine still produced ornithine (as detected by growth) in arginine-supplemented medium. The results suggest that the suppressor mutants were impaired in the feedback inhibition of ornithine synthesis by arginine. The activity of the appropriate biosynthetic enzyme was less sensitive to inhibition by arginine. The potential usefulness of such mutations is discussed.'

aS'Acetate kinases from the genus Veillonella were divided into two types: a succinate-stimulated enzyme and a succinate-independent enzyme. Three strains, V. parvula ATCC 17743 (antigenic group II), V. parvula ATCC 17744 (V), and V. parvula ATCC 10790 (VI), contained the succinate-stimulated enzyme. Among four types strains of V. alcalescens, three strains, ATCC 17747 (I), ATCC 17746 (III), and ATCC 17748 (VII), contained the succinate-independent enzyme, whereas only one strain, ATCC 17745 (IV), contained the succinate-stimulated enzyme. Small amounts of antiserum to the purified acetate kinase from V. alcalescens ATCC 17748 completely inhibited the purified and crude enzyme activity from the strain. Classification of the enzymes on the basis of stimulation by succinate was consistent with classification based on serological reactions using the antiserum as an independent parameter. The succinate-stimulated enzyme could be separated into two classes according to the degree of sensitivity to succinate: (i) enzymes from V. parvula ATCC 17744 and V. alcalescens ATCC 17745, which could be demonstrated on gel after electrophoresis by a histochemical method to be highly stimulated by the presence of succinate in the reaction mixture, and (ii) enzymes from V. parvula ATCC 10790 and V. parvula ATCC 17743, which could be easily demonstrated without succinate. Four groups of acetate kinases from the genus Veillonella were separated by gel electrophoretic mobility. The results showed that almost all enzymes from the seven type strains were heterogeneous at the molecular level.'

aS'An oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate/oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADP+/NAD+) nonspecific L-glutamate dehydrogenase from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron was purified 40-fold (NADP+ or NAD+ activity) over crude cell extract by heat treatment, (NH4)2SO2 fractionation, diethylaminoethyl-cellulose, Bio-Gel A 1.5m, and hydroxylapatite chromatography. Both NADP+- and NAD+-dependent activities coeluted from all chromatographic treatments. Moreover, a constant ratio of NADP+/NAD+ specific activities was demonstrated at each purification step. Both activities also comigrated in 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. Affinity chromatography of the 40-fold-purified enzyme using Procion RED HE-3B gave a preparation containing both NADP+- and NAD+-linked activities which showed a single protein band of 48,5000 molecular weight after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis. The dual pyridine nucleotide nature of the enzyme was most readily apparent in the oxidative direction. Reductively, the enzyme was 30-fold more active with reduced NADP than with reduced NAD. Nonlinear concave 1/V versus 1/S plots were observed for reduced NADP and NH4Cl. Salts (0.1 M) stimulated the NADP+-linked reaction, inhibited the NAD+-linked reaction, and had little effect on the reduced NADP-dependent reaction. The stimulatory effect of salts (NADP+) was nonspecific, regardless of the anion or cation, whereas the degree of NAD+-linked inhibition decreased in the order to I- greater than Br- greater than Cl- greater than F-. Both NADP+ and NAD+ glutamate dehydrogenase activities were also detected in cell extracts from representative strains of other bacteroides deoxyribonucleic acid homology groups.'

aS'Bacillus subtilis 168 was shown to contain a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) gyrase activity which closely resembled those of the enzymes isolated from Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus in its enzymatic requirements, substrate specificity, and sensitivity to several antibiotics. The enzyme was purified from the wild type and nalidixic acid-resistant and novobiocin-resistant mutants of B. subtilis and was functionally characterized in vitro. The genetic loci nalA and novA but not novB were shown to code for portions of the functional gyrase. Enzyme from the antibiotic-resistant mutants was resistant to the drug in vitro. The most striking observation was the remarkable similarity between the B. subtilis enzyme and other DNA gyrases, especially with respect to the oxolinic acid-induced DNA cleavage in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. All of the enzymes appeared to possess the same specificity of cutting sites regardless of the source or type of DNA used. This result implies that gyrase binding to DNA is highly specific.'

aS"The cellular structure of two yeast strains capable of growth on methane was investigated by electron microscopy. Microbodies were observed in cells of Sporobolomyces roseus strain Y and Rhodotorula glutinis strain CY when grown on methane but rarely when grown on glucose. The size of the microbodies and the number observed per cell in a thin section did not increase with culture age. No crystalline organization was observed within these organelles. Similar microbodies were also observed in cells of R. glutinis CY grown on hexadecane. The plasma membranes of both methane and hexadecane-grown cells exhibited increased invagination compared to that of glucose-grown cells. Catalase activity was detected in the microbodies of alkane-grown cells by using 3,3'-diaminobenzidine as a cytochemical stain. The data presented suggest that microbodies, and the catalase contained within them, play a role in eucaryotic methane metabolism."

aS'The extent of differential gene expression during morphogenesis of Mucor racemosus was investigated by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of neutral and acidic polypeptides. Cellular proteins were labeled with [35S]methionine in cells growing in either the yeast or hyphal form, or in yeast cells undergoing the transition of hyphae. The results showed that of the 400 to 500 polypeptides resolved by electrophoresis, relatively few were specific to one or the other morphological form. The major change in the patterns of proteins synthesized during morphogenesis was a change in rates of synthesis of individual polypeptides. Experiments in which morphogenesis was affected under aerobic or anaerobic conditions showed that the majority of changes in the protein patterns were associated with morphogenesis and were not a specific response to O2.'

aS'Stigmatella aurantiaca, a gliding, gram-negative bacterium, exhibits complex developmental changes upon starvation. In the light the cells aggregate and develop multicellular fruiting bodies with stalks and sporangia within 20 h. Between 23 and 27 h, sonication-resistant myxospores are synchronously formed inside the sporangia. On the other hand, in the dark, the cells aggregate and differentiate into myxospores between 13 and 27 h without forming stalks and sporangia. The pattern of protein synthesis during development in the light as well as in the dark was investigated. Three periods of synthesis, characterized by sharp increases and decreases in the rate of isotope incorporation into certain proteins, were distinguished. In the light these periods corresponded approximately to an early stage before the formation of aggregates, a middle period during which aggregates appeared and developed into fruiting bodies, and a late stage that corresponded to the appearance of myxospores. The pattern of protein synthesis in the dark could also be divided into three stages, but the middle stage was considerably shorter than in the light and showed diminished synthesis of certain proteins that were actively synthesized in the light. In particular, the synthesis of one protein was detected only in samples that developed in the light.'

The erythromycin resistance determinant is located on a 3.3-megadalton transposable element designated Tn917, which could be transposed to pAD1 as well as to two other plasmids, pAm gamma 1 and pAM alpha 1. When strain DS16 was exposed to low (inducing) concentrations of erythromycin for a few hours, the frequency of Tn917 transposition from pAD2 to pAD1 increased by an order of magnitude. This induction paralleled induction of erythromycin resistance and was prevented by exposing the cells to inhibitors of deoxyribonucleic acid, ribonucleic acid or protein synthesis. The exposure of strain DS16 to inducing concentrations of erythromycin also enhanced the frequency of erythromycin-resistant transconjugants appearing during mating. Initially, cointegrate molecules, whose molecular weights were approximately the sum of pAD1 and pAD2, accounted for these transconjugants; however, as the induction time increased, pAD1::Tn917 became increasingly prominent.'

aS'Phycobiliprotein degradation can be initiated in cultures of the cyanobacterium Anabaena by removal of combined nitrogen from the medium. Certain strains of Anabaena differentiate cells specialized for aerobic nitrogen fixation (heterocysts) under such conditions. We describe here a procedure for the preparation of extracts from heterocysts or vegetative cells that contain an activity capable of degrading only the phycobiliproteins in a mixture of soluble Anabaena proteins in vitro. This activity increased under nitrogen starvation conditions or in ammonia-replete cultures treated with the glutamine synthetase inhibitor methionine sulfoximine. The increase in activity induced by nitrogen starvation was prevented by chloramphenicol or by carbon starvation. Under all these conditions, phycobiliprotein degradative activity assayed in vitro was correlated with the loss of phycobiliprotein absorbance in vivo. Finally, starvation of a met auxotroph of Anabaena for methionine (in the presence of ammonia) did not induce phycobiliprotein degradation in vivo or the increase in proteinase activity. Together with direct measurements of ppGpp, these results indicate that proteolysis in Anabaena is not controlled by compounds associated with the stringent response in Escherichia coli. Since the increase in proteinase activity appears to be regulated by the same variables that control heterocyst differentiation, the activity should provide a useful biochemical marker for the early events of differentiation.'

aS'Highly purified cell walls of Chromatium vinosum were isolated by differential centrifugation, with or without Triton X-100 extraction. The isolated material had a protein composition similar to that of cell walls obtained by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Twenty-two proteins were reproducibly detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A 42-kilodalton protein was shown to account for 65% of the total cell wall protein. The majority of cell wall proteins were solubilized in sodium dodecyl sulfate at room temperature; however, they existed as high-molecular-weight complexes unless heated to 45 degrees C or above. The cell wall contained one heat-modifiable protein which migrated with an apparent molecular weight of 37,400 when solubilized at 70 degrees C or below, but which migrated with an apparent molecular weight of 52,500 if solubilized at 100 degrees C. The electrophoretic mobility of three proteins was modified by 2-mercaptoethanol. The majority of C. vinosum cell wall proteins had isoelectric points between pH 4.5 and 5.5, and the 42-kilodalton protein focused at pH 4.9. No proteins were detected which were analogous to the lipoprotein or peptidoglycan-associated proteins of the Enterobacteriaceae. Nearest-neighbor analysis with a reducible, cross-linking reagent indicated that three proteins, including the 42-kilodalton protein, associated with themselves. Most of the cell wall proteins were partially accessible to proteases in both intact cells and isolated cell walls. Protease treatment of the whole cell or isolated cell wall digested approximately an 11,000-molecular-weight portion of the 42-kilodalton protein.'

aS'The ultrastructure of a magnetotactic bacterium (strain MS-1) was examined by transmission, scanning, and scanning-transmission electron microscopy. The organism resembled other spirilla in general cell morphology, although some differences were detected at the ultrastructural level. Electron-dense particles within magnetotactic cells were shown by energy-dispersive X-ray analysis to be localizations containing iron. A non-magnetotactic variant of strain MS-1 lacked these novel bacterial inclusion bodies. A chain of these particles traversed each magnetotactic cell in a specific arrangement that was consistent from cell to cell, seemingly associated with the inner surface of the cytoplasmic membrane. Each particle was surrounded by an electron-dense layer separated from the particle surface by an electron-transparent region. The term "magnetosome" is proposed for the electron-dense particles with their enveloping layer(s) as found in this and other magnetotactic bacteria.'

aS"Neurospora crassa possesses a repressible acid phosphatase with phosphodiesterase activity which appears to permit it to utilize ribonucleic acid as a phosphorus and as a nitrogen source. This acid phosphatase, which is specified by the pho-3 locus, is derepressed approximately eightfold during nitrogen limitation and to an even greater extent during phosphorus limitation, but is unaffected by sulfur limitation. Derepression of the enzyme did not occur when adenosine 5'-monophosphate was the sole phosphorus or nitrogen source. Synthesis of the acid phosphatase is not under the control of the nit-2 locus, which regulates the expression of a large number of other nitrogen catabolic enzymes. The structural gene of the acid phosphatase appears to be a member of both the phosphorus and nitrogen regulatory circuits."

aS'Hydrolysis of sugar phosphates by crude and purified preparations of periplasmic hexose phosphatase from Salmonella typhimurium followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The enzyme bound glucose 1-phosphate with high affinity (Km = 10 microM) but bound glucose 6-phosphate with low affinity (Km = 2,000 microM). The order of substrate affinities was glucose 1-phosphate greater than mannose 1-phosphate = galactose 1-phosphate greater than fructose 1-phosphate greater than glucose 6-phosphate. These results and others suggest that the physiological function of the enzyme is the periplasmic hydrolysis of hexose 1-phosphates.'

aS'The location of the functionally important -SH groups of Escherichia coli ribosomal protein S1 along the polypeptide chain has been determined using a cysteine-specific cleavage procedure. The two -SH groups of S1 are located at 57% and 67% of the polypeptide chain length from the NH2 terminus. The -SH group farther from the NH2 terminus is shown to be the more reactive one. Two truncated derivatives of S1 (S1-F1 and m1-S1) both contain two -SH groups. It has previously been shown that S1-F1 (which lacks the NH2-terminal region of S1) is inactive in unfolding nucleic acids, just as the N-ethylmaleimide derivative of S1. The present results therefore show that the formation and functioning of the nucleic acid unfolding domain of protein S1 requires the -SH group(s) as well as the NH2-terminal region.'

aS"The pattern of proteins synthesized by chicken embryo fibroblasts changes dramatically after these cells are incubated at 45 degrees C for a few hours. Three proteins (Mr = 22,000, 76,000, and 95,000) account for almost 50% of the cell's protein synthetic capacity immediately after the heat-shock (Kelley, P.M., and Schlesinger, M.J. (1978) Cell 15, 1277-1286). When mRNAs were isolated from heat-shocked cells and translated in a cell-free protein synthesizing system, a pattern of proteins virtually identical with that made by intact heat-shocked cells was detected. Mobilities in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and radioimmune precipitation with specific antisera were used to establish the identity of in vitro- and in vivo-generated heat-shock proteins. The mRNAs coding for the major heat-shock proteins could be separated by rate zonal centrifugation in a sucrose gradient and mRNAs with sedimentation coefficients of 20 S, 18 S, and 13 S were translated in vitro to yield proteins of 95, 76, and 22 kilodaltons, respectively."

aS'Preferential labeling of COOH-terminal sequences in newly synthesized fibronectin was achieved by short term incorporation of radiolabeled amino acids in the presence of pactamycin, an inhibitor of polypeptide chain initiation. The labeled fibronectin was then cleaved with cathepsin D under conditions that yield a large (137,000-dalton) fragment that lacks collagen-binding properties, and a smaller (72,000-dalton) fragment that retains the ability of fibronectin to bind to collagen. Determination of the relative specific radioactivities of the two fragments leads us to conclude that the collagen-binding domain in fibronectin is located in the NH2-terminal third of the polypeptide chain and not in a COOH-terminal region as previously indicated by other structural studies.'

aS"Urinary acidification in the turtle urinary bladder is due to a reversible proton-translocating ATPase. To estimate the H+/ATP stoichiometry of this pump, we measured the delta G'ATP in the epithelial cells and the maximum e.m.f. generated by the pump. The latter is the maximal transepithelial electrochemical gradient for protons placed across the epithelium that is needed to nullify the rate of transport and averaged 179 +/- 7 mV. The delta G'ATP averaged 50.1 kJ/mol. The H+/ATP stoichiometry of these bladders was 2.92 +/- 0.1. In other experiments, the bladders were poisoned by iodoacetate and cyanide and a variable transepithelial electrochemical gradient for protons was placed across them. It was noted that ATP synthesis occurred at a transepithelial electrochemical gradient for protons greater than 120 mV. The delta G'ATP in other bladders treated identically averaged 40.0 kJ/mol, giving a H+/ATP stoichiometry of 3.4 +/- 0.1. We conclude that the H+/ATP stoichiometry of the proton pump of turtle urinary bladder is approximately 3."

By quantifying production of 1,3-bis-P-glycerate from the phosphorothioate analogue of ATP as a function of time as the reaction approaches equilibrium, Keq for the reaction was estimated to be approximately 400, about 1 order of magnitude less than the equilibrium constant previously reported for the analogous reaction of the normal nucleotide substrates.'

We found 3 iron atoms/monomer and a spin concentration of 0.9 spins/monomer for the oxidized protein. Taken together, the EPR and M\xc3\xb6ssbauer data demonstrate conclusively the presence of a spin-coupled structure containing 3 iron atoms and labile sulfur. The M\xc3\xb6ssbauer data show also that this metal center is structurally similar, if not identical, with the low potential center of a ferredoxin from Azotobacter vinelandii, a novel cluster described recently (Emptage, M.H., Kent, T.A., Huynh, B.H., Rawlings, J., Orme-Johnson, W.H., and M\xc3\xbcnck, E.

aS'The binding reaction of NADH to liver alcohol dehydrogenase was investigated at temperatures to -45 degrees C using a cryosolvent composed of 50% aqueous dimethylsulfoxide. At temperatures below -30 degrees C, the reaction produced biphasic changes in the protein fluorescence. The slow phase caused a 15 to 20% quenching of protein fluorescence, reached a maximum at 50 to 100 micro M  NADH, and had an energy of activation of 27.3 kcal/mol. The fast phase appeared to be linearly dependent upon NADH concentration, produced a 45 to 50% quenching of the protein fluorescence, and had an energy of activation of 19.6 kcal/mol. The results are interpreted in terms of a three-step binding reaction, corresponding to initial complexation followed by conformational changes.'

aS'The pokeweed antiviral protein and the toxin ricin are two plant proteins which enzymatically inactivate eukaryotic ribosomes and cause the inhibition of the elongation cycle of protein synthesis. Their mode of inhibition of protein synthesis has been attributed to either the inhibition of enzymatic binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the acceptor site of the ribosome or its subsequent translocation to the donor site. In this communication, we show that the treatment of ribosomes with either the pokeweed antiviral protein or ricin results in the inhibition of the elongation factor 2-catalyzed translocation of acceptor site aminoacyl-tRNA to the donor site. The inhibitory effects of both proteins are identical and are partially reversed by excess concentrations of elongation factor 2.'

aS'Transport of methotrexate by L1210 sensitive and resistant cell lines was studied using [3H]methotrexate and methotrexate. The intracellular and cellular efflux of drug was analyzed by radioligand binding assay and high performance liquid chromatography. It was shown that the initial, rapid uptake of [3H]methotrexate was not methotrexate but rather [3H]p-aminobenzoylglutamate, even when the [3H]methotrexate was greater than 97% homogeneous. In the mutant cell line, the impurity could account for all of the apparent methotrexate uptake at 1 to 10 micro M extracellular drug. Similarly, the rapid efflux of [3H]methotrexate was also shown to be all, or in part, 3H-impurities, in both the mutant and sensitive cell lines. These results do not conflict with the currently accepted model of a carrier-mediated process for reduced folate and antifolate transport but do suggest that the quantitative interpretation of the early time points of transport experiments be more critically evaluated, especially when mutant cell lines are being analyzed.'

aS'The rate of transport of alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB) has been measured in Swiss 3T3 cells at different cell densities in the range 10(3) to 5 x 10(4) cells/cm2. There is a pronounced increase in the rate of Na+-dependent AIB uptake below 4 x 10(3) cells/cm2, which can be observed both in growing cells (10% serum) or in cells arrested early in the G1 (G0) portion of the cell cycle in medium containing plasma-derived serum. The rate of AIB transport of cells arrested in G0 can be inhibited by the addition of a plasma membrane-enriched fraction prepared from 3T3 cells. The results are interpreted in terms of two elements that control the rate of AIB transport, one dependent on the position in the cell cycle and the other on cell contact. Preliminary observations suggest that BALB 3T3 cells behave in a similar way.'

aS'Surface aromatic residues of bovine alpha-lactalbumin were detected by laser photo-CIDNP NMR spectroscopy in the submillimolar (100 micro M) range. The association behavior of this protein was observed in this range (Kd approximately equal to 100 micro M) by the variation in absolute NMR peak intensities for surface polarized residues as the monomer-monomer association step lowered surface residue accessibilities. This example was also the first case reported for laser photo-CIDNP studies of proteins where all three polarizable aromatic residues (tyrosine, tryptophan, and histidine) were observed.'

aS'Cvc- mutants of Escherichia coli are deficient in the synthesis of cis-vaccenic acid and in the temperature control of fatty acid synthesis.

The deficiencies in cis-vaccenate synthesis and synthase II are shown to be due to a lesion in the same gene, fabF. Lesions in the fabF gene are found to affect growth only when the strain also carries a lesion in the fabB gene, the structural gene for beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase I.'

aS'Total glycopeptides from human K-562 cells, labeled metabolically with [3H]glucosamine or [3H]mannose, were prepared by extracting the cells with organic solvents to remove lipids and by digesting the residue with pronase. 3H-labeled glycopeptides were fractionated on Sephadex G-50 revealing a high molecular weight fraction (Mr = 7,000 to 11,000), comprising approximately 10% of the [3H]glucosamine and 25% of the [3H]mannose label. Digestion of this glycopeptide fraction with endo-beta-galactosidase from Escherichia freundii, specific for a repeating structure of Gal(beta 1 leads to 4)GlcNAc(beta 1 leads to 3), results in the following four products as resolved by Bio-Gel P-2 gel filtration: 1) a disaccharide with the structure beta-2-deoxy-2-acetamidoglucosyl leads to beta-galactose; 2) a trisaccharide with the structure beta-galactosyl leads to beta-2-deoxy-2-acetamidoglucosyl leads to beta-galactose; 3) a tetrasaccharide with the sequence alpha-N-acetylneuraminyl leads to beta-galactosyl leads to beta-2-deoxy-2-acetamidoglucosyl leads to beta-galactose; and 4) a larger, complex fragment which contains mannose and beta-2-deoxy-2-acetamidoglucose and which is probably the protein linkage region. In addition, visualization of radiolabeled glycoproteins by fluorography on polyacrylamide gels revealed a 105,000-dalton "Band 3"-like glycoprotein and other bands that were sensitive to endo-beta-galactosidase. These results indicate that the K-562 cell line bears a glycopeptide, erythroglycan, which has been found on erythrocytes, and that this polymer is expressed mainly in the fetal form as a linear chain.'

aS"Liver glycogen phosphorylase associated with the glycogen pellet was activated by a MgATP-dependent process. This activation was reduced by 90% by ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid, not affected by the inhibitor of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and increased 2.5-fold by the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Low levels of free Ca2+ (8 x 10(-8) M) completely prevented the effects of the chelator. The activation of phosphorylase by MgATP was shown not to be due to formation of AMP. DEAE-cellulose chromatography of the glycogen pellet separated phosphorylase from phosphorylase kinase. The isolated phosphorylase was no longer activated by MgATP in the presence or absence of the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The isolated phosphorylase kinase phosphorylated and activated skeletal muscle phosphorylase b and the activation was increased 2- to 3-fold by the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Mixing the isolated phosphorylase and phosphorylase kinase together restored the effects of MgATP and the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase on phosphorylase activity. These findings demonstrate that the phosphorylase kinase associated with liver glycogen has regulatory features similar to those of muscle phosphorylase kinase."

aS"The beta 93 sulfhydryl groups of oxyhemoglobins A and S display a difference in reactivity with 5,5'-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid. It is concluded that this difference arises from differences in tertiary structure in the vicinity of the beta 93 site. Organic phosphates decrease the beta 93 sulfhydryl reactivity. We have used this effect to measure the organic phosphate binding constants. Hemoglobin S binds organic phosphates very weakly compared to hemoglobin A. This result indicates that the structure at the organic phosphate binding site is different in the two oxyhemoglobins and may be the result of differences in the structure of the NH2-terminal ends of the beta chains."

aS'The complete amino acid sequence has been determined for the alpha chain of component III of the hemoglobin of the tadpole of the bullfrog, Rana catesbeiana. The chain comprises 141 residues of which 80 (57%) are identical to those in the corresponding positions of the human chain. Almost the same extent of similarity exists in the comparison with the sequenced part of the alpha chain of the adult bullfrog. The major features of this chain are: 1) each residue which is common to all other alpha chains of known sequence is also found in this alpha chain; 2) an acetylated NH2 terminus prevents formation of one of the salt bridges found in human hemoglobin which is responsible for part of the alkaline Bohr effect in mammalian hemoglobins; and 3) a prolyl residue at alpha 99 (G6) must distort the G helix.'

aS'The amino acid sequence of the beta chain of component III of the hemoglobin of the tadpole of the bullfrog. Rana catesbeiana, has been determined. Comparison of this sequence with the 117 identified residues of the beta chain in the adult bullfrog shows that 50% (59 of 117) of the residues are identical; 55% (81 of 146) are identical in the comparison with the human beta chain. Tadpole hemoglobin lacks most of the residues believed responsible for the alkaline Bohr effect in human hemoglobin: the NH2 terminus is acetylated and histidine H5 (alpha 122) in the human alpha chain is replaced by glutamine in the tadpole. Although the tadpole beta chain has a COOH-terminal histidine, the hydrogen bond responsible in human hemoglobin for about one-half the normal alkaline Bohr effect cannot form, because asparagine rather than aspartate is present at position 94. However, histidyl residue H21 (beta 143), invoked to explain the reversed "acid" Bohr effect in human hemoglobin, is present in the tadpole chain and is adjacent to a seryl residue (beta 144) rather than lysyl residue, so that the pK of the beta 143 histidine should be higher than in human hemoglobin. This could explain the substantial acid Bohr effect in tadpole hemoglobin.'

aS'The synthesis of 3-trifluoromethyl-3-phenyldiazirine (TPD) is reported in an overall yield of 60% based on 2,2,2-trifluoroacetophenone as starting material. TPD is rapidly photolyzed on irradiation near 350 nm to yield 35% of the diazoisomer and 65% of the corresponding carbene. No internal rearrangement of the latter compound by fluorine migration was detected. Photolysis in methanol yielded the product of a formal OH insertion in greater than 95% yield. Photolysis in cyclohexane gave at least a 50% yield of the CH insertion product at a diazirine concentration of 15 mM. The products were identified by gas chromatographic mass spectra and by 19F NMR spectra. In the dark the diazirine is stable in 1 M acid or base and at temperatures as high as 75 degrees C for at least 30 min. The diazoisomer is much less photolabile and is stable in 0.1 M acetic acid for at least 12 h. The synthesis of a derivative of TPD containing the 2-hydroxyethyl[O-tosylate] group on the para position of the phenyl ring is described. This compound permits the easy attachment of the TPD function to other molecules. It is suggested that the ease of synthesis, dark stability, rapid photolysis, and reactivity of the carbene may make this group useful in the preparation of various photochemical probes.'

aS'Analogues of fatty acids have been synthesized which contain an S-S bridge in the aliphatic chain and at the omega-carbon the photoactivatable p-(3-trifluoromethyldiazirino)phenyl or p-azidophenyl group as a carbene and nitrene precursor, respectively. These acids were used to acylate 1-palmitoyl phosphatidylcholine by the procedure described by Gupta et al. (Gupta, C.M., Radhakrishnan, R., and Khorana, H.G. (1977) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 74, 4315-4319). Multilamellar liposomes prepared from various radioactively labeled lipids and 2 to 10 mol% of one of the photosensitive phospholipid analogues were photolyzed and the extent of cross-linking was determined. The carbene-generating probe labeled dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine in yields of 15 to 20%, while labeling with the nitrene probe was about 10 times less efficient. In contrast these probes were found to react with the unsaturated fatty acid of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine with almost equal efficiency. The nitrene was 2 to 3 times more efficient than the carbene in cross-linking to gramicidin A. Amino acid analysis and Edman degradation of the labeled peptide indicated that both probes predominantly attacked tryptophan residues. No geometrical correlation was found between the expected penetration of the reactive group of the probe within the bilayer and the labeled sites of the peptide. This result is discussed in terms of chemical selectivities of the photoactivated intermediates. After photocross-linking, the disulfide bridge can be cleaved to generate a free sulfhydryl group which subsequently can be utilized for preparative or analytical purposes. Photolabeled lipids and peptides can be separated easily from the bulk of the unlabeled material. These phospholipid analogues are substrates for the phospholipid exchange protein isolated from calf liver. Transfer from sonicated dispersions of the analogues into an acceptor membrane was demonstrated. Individual monolayers can thus be labeled separately with these reagents.'

aS'The interaction of stearoyl-(1,N6)-etheno coenzyme A (stearoyl-epsilon-CoA) with acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase was investigated by using fluorescence spectroscopy. The fluorescence emission of stearoyl-epsilon-CoA was partially quenched by acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase. Analysis of the data for dissociation constant (KD) and the stoichiometry of the interaction (n) gave values of 5.06 nM and 1.2, respectively, at pH 7.6 in 50 mM Tris-HCl and 25 degrees C. The KD value is comparable to the inhibition constant (Ki) obtained previously by others for the inhibition of rat liver acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase by long chain fatty acyl-CoAs. Citrate (which is known to polymerize and thus activate carboxylase) caused a partial quenching of the protein fluorescence of carboxylase, presumably due to polymerization of the enzyme. The quenching of the stearoyl-epsilon-CoA fluorescence caused by carboxylase as well as the inhibition of carboxylase activity by stearoyl-epsilon-CoA was reversed by citrate, but only in the presence of 6-O-methylglucose polysaccharide which forms a stable complex with fatty acyl-CoA. This shows that the stearoyl-epsilon-CoA bound to the enzyme is displaced by citrate only in the presence of an acceptor of fatty acyl-CoA. These results support the reciprocal relationship of citrate and fatty acyl-CoA in the regulation of acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase.'

aS'We have studied factors affecting the catalytic activity of dihydroorotase (EC 3.5.2.3), purified as part of a multienzymatic protein which contains carbamyl phosphate synthetase, aspartate transcarbamylase, and dihydroorotase (ME pyr1-3) and which initiates de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis in mouse Ehrlich ascites carcinoma. The apparent Km value for N-carbamyl-L-aspartate increases by 2 orders of magnitude as the pH increases from 7.0 to 8.3, consistent with equilibration of dihydroorotase (E) between four states of protonation (E in equilibrium EH in equilibrium EH2 equilibrium EH3), where EH3 is the only catalytically active form of dihydroorotase for the biosynthetic reaction, having a Km for N-carbamyl-L-aspartate of 30 micro M. The apparent Km for L-dihydroorotate shows a converse dependence upon pH, remaining relatively constant at alkaline pH and increasing progressively as the pH is decreased below 7.0. These data are consistent with the above model if E and EH are catalytically active for the degradative reaction, both having Km values of 4.4 micro M for L-5,6-dihydroorotate. The D isomers of carbamylaspartate and dihydroorotate are also substrates for dihydroorotase. At pH 7.33, the apparent Km values for N-carbamyl-L-aspartate and N-carbamyl-D-aspartate are 247 and 204 micro M, respectively, but the Vmax for N-carbamyl-D-aspartate is only 1.7% of that obtained with N-carbamyl-L-aspartate. Orotate and a series of 5-substituted derivatives are competitive inhibitors of dihydroorotase. At pH 7.27, the apparent Ki for orotate using N-carbamyl-L-aspartate as substrate is 170 micro M and with L-5,6-dihydroorotate as substrate, the apparent Ki value is 9.6 micro M, suggesting that the enzyme exists in different forms in the presence of each substrate. Dihydroorotase is inhibited in a time-dependent manner by 50 mM L-cysteine and the presence of N-carbamyl-L-aspartate or L-5,6-dihydroorotate protects against this ultimately complete inactivation. 2-Mercaptoacetate, 2-mercaptoethylamine, 3-mercaptopropionate, and L-2,3-diaminopropionate have a similar although less potent inhibitory effect. To account for the data obtained, we propose a model for the equilibria existing between various protonated forms of dihydroorotase which is consistent with the pH dependencies of the apparent Km values observed and the Vmax values observed previously (Christopherson, R.I., and Jones, M.E. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 12506-12512). In addition, a catalytic mechanism is presented for the interconversion of N-carbamyl-L-aspartate and L-5,6-dihydroorotate.'

aS'Cultured human skin fibroblasts incubated at 37 degrees C with sonically dispersed, positively charged liposomes containing sphingomyelin internalized and metabolized the phospholipid. Sphingomyelin incorporation into the cells produced a reduction in low density lipoprotein binding and degradation. Lecithin-containing liposomes were much less effective. In addition, incubation with sphingomyelin resulted in a marked increase in acetate incorporation into sterol. These results suggest that sphingomyelin, which is required by cells for membrane synthesis, can influence the regulation of the cell surface low density lipoprotein receptor and intracellular cholesterol balance.'

aS'Effects of K+ and Na+ on the transient state kinetics of (Na+ + K+)-ATPase from Electrophorus electricus were examined. Exposure of the enzyme to K+ for brief intervals prior to the addition of ATP and Na+ converts the enzyme to a form (E2 . K) which is transiently less reactive than when all three ligands are added simultaneously. Enzyme is reconverted to the rapidly reacting (E1) form if Na+ is added prior to ATP. Exposure of the ATPase to K+ without Na+ for 1 to 2 h partially restores the initial phosphate (Pi) burst but greatly depresses the amount of phosphoprotein intermediate (E-P) observed. Experiments in the presence of valinomycin suggest that much of this depression in E-P is related to the presence of sealed vesicles with K+ sites sequestered in the interior. Although the results are largely consistent with a simple model in which ATP hydrolysis occurs only through the phosphoenzyme intermediate, the partial restoration of the Pi burst following long term exposure to K+ appears to be attributable to a slow change which may allow some ATP hydrolysis to occur within formation of a phosphoenzyme intermediate.'

aS'Reaction of the antitumor protein neocarzinostatin with 1,2-cyclohexanedione in 0.25 M borate buffer, pH 9.0, resulted in complete modification of arginine residues in positions 66, 67, and 78. The arginine-modified protein lost its native structure and was biologically inactive in the inhibition of growth of HeLa cells, inhibition of DNA synthesis, and in vitro DNA strand scissions. Trypsin hydrolysis of 1,2-cyclohexanedione-modified neocarzinostatin resulted in selective cleavage of the Lys-Val (positions 20 and 21) bond of the primary structure yielding NH2-terminal 1-20 and the COOH-terminal 21-109 residue fragments. The latter contained modified arginine residues. Both peptide fragments were biologically inactive. Treatment of the arginine-modified neocarzinostatin and the arginine-protected 89-residue fragment with 0.25 M Tris-acetate buffer, pH 9.0, for 15 h resulted in the release of 1,2-cyclohexanedione, regenerating all three arginine residues. The regenerated protein and the 89-residue fragment were fully active biologically. Further, the regenerated 89-residue fragment possessed 70% of the reactivity of neocarzinostatin with antibody raised against the native protein. The conformation of the 89-residue fragment was almost identical with that of the native protein in CD spectral properties.'

aS'Heparin accelerates the rate of reaction of antithrombin with thrombin, an effect which is abolished by mild reduction of the antithrombin with dithiothreitol. Reduced antithrombin incorporates 1.7 mol of [14C]acetamide/mol of protein, with cysteine as the only amino acid modified. Tryptic digestion of the reduced and alkylated antithrombin results in the formation of only two labeled peptides. In the absence of heparin, the second order rate constant for the reaction of thrombin with both reduced and native antithrombin is 5.9 to 9.6 x 10(5) M-1 min-1. In the presence of heparin, the rate constant for the reaction between reduced antithrombin and thrombin is 8.3 to 12.2 x 10(5) M-1 min-1, while the rate of reaction between native antithrombin and thrombin is too fast to follow under the conditions used. Reduced antithrombin elutes from a heparin-Sepharose column at 0.5 M NaCl, contrast to 10 M NaCl required for elution of the native protein. The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence enhancement caused by heparin binding to native antithrombin is not observed with reduced antithrombin. These data indicate that cleavage of one of the three antithrombin disulfide bonds results in reduced affinity for heparin and the loss of heparin-accelerated antithrombin activity and imply that heparin and thrombin bind at different sites on the antithrombin molecule.'

aS'The fluorescent phospholipid dansyl phosphatidylethanolamine (DPE) (dansyl, 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl) was incorporated into very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) to form DPE-VLDL. The addition of milk lipoprotein lipase to DPE-VLDL in the presence of albumin resulted in a greater than 3-fold fluorescence increase and a 20 nm blue shift in the wavelength of the emission maxima of the dansyl fluorophore. The lipoprotein lipase-induced fluorescence changes occurred concomitantly with the release of free fatty acids from VLDL. Lipoprotein lipase did not produce fluorescence changes in DPE incorporated into either low or high density lipoproteins. The rate of fluorescence increase in DPE-VLDL was maximal at 37 degrees C, dependent on the concentration of lipoprotein lipase and VLDL, and followed typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a Km of 1.0 for lipoprotein lipase. Both the initial rate and the total fluorescence increase correlated well (r = 0.98 and 0.95) with the release of free fatty acids. We conclude that the lipoprotein lipase-induced fluorescence increases in DPE-VLDL provide an accurate, convenient, and the only noninvasive means of following continuously the lipolysis of human VLDL.'

aS'The synthesis and physical properties of a model metalloflavin complex, [(10-methylisoalloxazine)-(NH3)4Ru](PF6)2 . 2H2O are reported. The structure of this stable, enantiomeric compound was elucidated by x-ray diffraction methods with a final unweighted R value of 0.054. Crystals belong to the triclinic space group P1 with unit cell dimensions: a = 9.631, b = 10.618, c = 13.216 A; alpha = 113.86, beta = 100.19, gamma = 94.12 degrees. Chelation of the metal ion to the flavin occurs at the N(5) and O(4) positions, with a short Ru-N(5) bond distance of 1.979 A. Steric and electronic factors induce a 9.9 degrees bend in the isoalloxazine ring system and a significant lengthening of the C(4a)-N(5) bond. The flavin absorption bands shift significantly toward lower energy on complexation and a new band occurs at 617 nm. These absorptions are pH-dependent and pK alpha values for the complex are 0.6 and 7.4. The spectra of this complex exhibit similarities to that of metallosemiquinone species and arguments are made that a significant amount of electron density is donated to the pi-system of the flavin. Proton NMR studies suggest enhanced electron density at the N(10) position, probably occurring through backbonding interactions. Cyclic voltametry studies are also consistent with substantial metal to ligand pi-electron donation, since it is significantly more difficult to reduce the coordinated flavin relative to the free ligand under the same conditions. Moreover, the complexed flavin accepts electrons in 1-electron rather than 2-electron steps. Spectroelectrochemical studies on the 1-electron reduced complex indicate a similarity with other M(II)-F1 species.'

aS'L-Alanine transaminase (EC 2.6.1.2) from pig heart was found to be a dimer, with a subunit molecular weight of 55,000 and one pyridoxal phosphate bound/subunit. Seven free sulfhydryl groups/subunit were detected. Isoelectric focusing revealed three species (native pI values, 5.3 to 5.5). L-Propargylglycine was found to inactivate the enzyme at 37 degrees C with a KI = 3.9 mM and an observed maximal first order rate constant, kinact = 0.26 min-1. Incorporation of 1 [14C]propargylglycine molecule/dimer leads to greater than 97% inactivation, suggesting half-site reactivity, while the unalkylated subunit is still apparently capable of processing L-alanine, L-propargylglycine, and beta-chloro-L-alanine. The minimal stoichiometric ratio necessary for inactivation was determined to be 2.7 L-propargylglycine molecules/enzyme subunit, 2.2 molecules/subunit undergoing transamination before inactivation ensues. A deuterium kinetic isotope effect of 3.5 was observed for inactivation with DL-[2-2H]propargylglycine.'

aS'Complete purification of human renin from noncancerous, autopsied kidneys is reported. A 480,000-fold purification was achieved to yield renin with a specific activity of 950 Goldblatt units/mg. This preparation satisfied multiple criteria of purity as tested by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing, specific activity, analytical ultracentrifugation, and immunodouble diffusion. The molecular weight of the pure enzyme determined by sedimentation equilibrium is 40,000. The apparent molecular weight estimated by gel filtration is 41,000. The enzyme has an isoelectric point of pH 5.7. Human renin shows an affinity for concanavalin A, suggesting the presence of carbohydrates. These properties and the amino acid composition of human renin are different from those of renin obtained from other mammalian species. Human renin antibodies prepared with the pure enzyme preparation showed negligible cross-reactivity with renin from other mammalian species. The activity with homologous human renin substrate has a pH optimum of 6, whereas with substrates from other mammalian species the optima were in higher or lower pH ranges.'

aS'The diffusion coefficients for glucose and sucrose within matrices of hyaluronic acid are contrasted with coefficients determined in matrices of agarose. Diffusivity is similar in 0.5 and 1% matrices of both polysaccharide polymers dissolved in saline (0.9% NaCl solution) buffered at pH 7.4 with 0.01 M sodium phosphate. In a 2.5% matrix of hyaluronate, but not agarose, glucose diffusivity is enhanced 3-fold, whereas simultaneously determined sucrose diffusivity remains unchanged from that in the 1% matrix. The 1% hyaluronate matrix will enhance glucose diffusivity if an inorganic cationic serum constituent(s) with a molecular weight of less than 500 is incorporated into the solvent. This enhanced diffusivity is inversely dependent on glucose concentration and on the degree of polymerization of the hyaluronate in the matrix. The presence of an appropriately constituted matrix of hyaluronic acid endows the resultant fluid with several properties generally ascribed to membranes: permselectivity (even glucose and sucrose behave differently), saturability, and the potential to enhance translational movement of selected solutes such as glucose.'

aS"Amber mutations in the rpoB gene specifying the beta subunit of RNA polymerase coupled with conditional amber suppressors were used to restrict the synthesis of core RNA polymerase in strains of Escherichia coli. Such a restriction stimulated transcription of genetic units containing RNA polymerase subunit genes. Within the L10 transcription unit (genetic structure: promotor (PL10), rplJ (L10), rplL (L7/L12), attenuator, rpoB (beta), rpoC (beta'), terminator), the initiation of transcription at the promotor was enhanced and termination at the transcription attenuator was relaxed. Transcription of the genetic unit containing the rpoA gene (alpha) was also enhanced. In the strain containing a non-polar amber mutation, the synthesis rate of the beta' subunit protein during the restriction correlated with the level of transcription of the beta and beta' genes. In contrast, synthesis of L7/L12 ribosomal protein remained essentially unaltered in spite of the elevated levels of L10-L7/L12 mRNA."

aS'Transient and steady state kinetics of the interaction of liver plasma membrane adenylyl cyclase with GTP and the GTP analogues guanyl-5\'-yl imidodiphosphate (GMP-P(NH)P), guanyl-5\'-yl diphosphonate (GMP-P(CH2)P), and guanosine 5\'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) was studied before and after treatment of membranes with preactivated cholera toxin. (a) In control experiments, GTP stimulated the enzyme partially and without a noticeable lag, while GTP analogues stimulated to varying degrees (GTP gamma S approximately GMP-P(NH)P greater than GMP-P(CH2)P greater than or equal to GTP) and with lag periods that varied with the nucleotide (GMP-P(NH)P approximately GMP-P(CH2)P greater than GTP gamma S). (b) In toxin-treated membranes, transient kinetics and degree of activation by GTP analogues were unaltered, while activation by GTP remained rapid and became as effective as the most effective of the analogues. (c) Toxin treatment had no effect on the concentration-effect curves for GTP analogues but resulted in a 5- to 9-fold lowering of the apparent K alpha with which GTP stimulates the system. These results indicate that the degree of stimulation of the liver adenylyl cyclase by GTP and its analogues is independent of the susceptibility of the beta-gamma bond of the guanosine triphosphate to be hydrolyzed and that lags in progress curves are not due to slow dissociation of "resident" GDP molecules. The time transients of the interaction of the rat liver adenylyl cyclase with combinations of GTP and GMP-P(NH)P were studied and found to be of the competitive type regardless of the time and sequence of addition of the two nucleotides. The results are consistent with GMP-P(NH)P interacting with and dissociating from the system very slowly and not leading to the formation of an irreversibly activated state of the enzyme. The data obtained on regulation of the basic (no hormone added) liver adenylyl cyclase by guanyl nucleotides are interpreted in terms of a two-state enzyme model (Birnbaumer, L., Bearer, C.F., and Iyengar, R. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 3552-3557) and the results are discussed in the light of current views of regulation of adenylyl cyclases and involvement of a GTPase. Our experiments are consistent with, but not proof for, presence of a cholera toxin-inhibited GTPase in intimate association with the liver adenylyl cyclase.'

aS'Four 15-oxygenated sterols with the "unnatural" cis-C-D ring juncture have recently been shown to be potent inhibitors of sterol synthesis in animal cells in culture (Schroepfer, G.J., Jr., Parish, E.J., Chen, H.W., and Kandutsch, A.A. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 8975-8980; Schroepfer, G.J., Jr., Pascal, R.A., Jr., and Kandutsch, A.A. (1979) Biochem. Pharmacol. 28, 249-252). In the present study we have prepared two of these sterols, [2,4-3H]5 alpha,14 beta-cholest-7-ene-3 beta,15 alpha-diol and [2,4-3H]5 alpha,14 beta-cholest-7-ene-3 beta,15 beta-diol, in labeled form, 5 alpha,14 beta-Cholest-7-ene-3 beta, 15 alpha-diol, but not its 15 beta-hydroxy epimer, was shown to be efficiently converted to cholesterol in 10,000 x g supernatant fractions of liver homogenate preparations from both male and female rats. After incubation of [2,4-3H]5 alpha,14 beta-cholest-7-ene-3 beta,15 alpha-diol with these enzyme preparations a number of labeled products, in addition to cholesterol, were isolated and characterized. These included 5 alpha-cholesta-8,14-dien-3 beta-ol, cholesta-5,7-dien-3 beta-ol, 5 alpha-cholest-8-en-3 beta-ol, and 5 alpha-cholest-7-en-3 beta-ol.

aS'A kinetic and equilibrium binding study of the interaction of 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3) with its receptor system from chick intestinal mucosa has been carried out. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) for the binding of 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 to the crude cytoplasmic receptor varies from 2.3 x 10(-10) M at 4 degrees C to 5.0 x 10(-10) M at 24 degrees C, yielding values for delta G0, delta H0 and delta S0 for the dissociation process of 12.2 +/- 0.1 kcal/ mol, 6.7 +/- 1.2 kcal/mol, and -19.9 +/- 3.2 cal/degree mol. This suggests that the binding of 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 to the receptor may be an entropy-driven process. Kinetic studies on the association and dissociation of the 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 . receptor complex revealed that kassoc varied from 0.6 x 10(7) M-1 min-1 at 0 degrees C to 14.5 x 10(7) M-1 min-1 at 30 degrees C and that kdiss varied from 4 x 10(-5) min-1 at 4 degrees C to 4 x 10(-2) min-1 at 30 degrees C. The activation energy for the association process was found to be 17 kcal/mol, while that for the dissociation reaction was 45 kcal/mol.'

aS'Supernatant Protein Factor (SPF), a protein that enhances the activities of microsomal squalene epoxidase and 2,3-oxidosqualene-lanosterol cyclase, has been labeled either by acylation with N-succinimidyl[2,3-3H]propionate or by reductive methylation with [14C]-formaldehyde and sodium cyanoborohydride. Labeled SPF preparations, containing 1 to 2 modified lysine residues/molecule of protein which retained full biological activity, were found to bind only weakly to microsomes under a variety of experimental conditions as determined by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. No interaction between SPF and either squalene or squalene-2,3-oxide could be demonstrated by gel filtration. On the other hand, SPF was shown to bind tightly to vesicles of anionic phospholipids (phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidic acid) but not to vesicles of phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylethanolamine. The capacity of the anionic phospholipids to bind to SPF parallels their ability to enhance the stimulatory activity of SPF. These observations are inconsistent with the designation of proteins of this type as "sterol carrier proteins."'

aS"Based on previous evidence (T.J. Lindell (1976) Nature 263, 347-350 and T.J. Lindell, A.F. O'Malley, and B. Puglisi (1978) Biochemistry 17, 1154-1160) it was anticipated that actinomycin D in a low concentration would bind to DNA which is involved in the regulation of rRNA transcription in eukaryotes. This was examined by digestion of rat (liver) DNA with EcoRI, adding [3H]actinomycin D (0.004 microgram/ml) and resolution of the restriction fragments by RPC-5 chromatography. Labeled actinomycin D was found to bind with highest affinity to a single fraction consistently eluting at 0.63 M KCl. A similar digestion and fractionation of nucleolar DNA, which is enriched in rDNA sequences, did not reveal a similar high affinity binding of actinomycin D. This fraction of DNA which binds actinomycin D with highest affinity did not contain any rDNA as evidenced by hybridization with [32P]rRNA. Therefore, at the concentration of 0.004 microgram/ml, actinomycin D does not selectively bind to rDNA as evidenced by two independent criteria. Whether this high affinity actinomycin D-binding DNA has any function in the regulation of rRNA transcription remains to be determined."

aS'The amounts of DNA in individual cells of synchronized or log phase cultures can be determined from flow cytometry measurements of DNA:propidium fluorescence. We have used a model based on cell transit times through the cell cycle to obtain rates of DNA synthesis corresponding to different parts of the S phase of log phase cells. The five rates predicted by this method for log phase HeLa cells correlate well with those obtained by following the progression of highly synchronized HeLa cells through S phase. The absolute values of the rates can be expressed in channel number (proportional to fluorescent intensity), picograms of DNA, number of nucleotides, or molecular weight of DNA versus time, when the total cell cycle time is known, or in relative units, when it is not. The fastest rates for HeLa and 2RA cells are at the beginning and end of S phase, whereas WI-38 cells exhibited a gradual increase in rates from beginning to end of S phase. The determination of rates of DNA synthesis in log phase cultures, rather than synchronized ones, represents a substantial reduction in time, eliminates the possibility of induced metabolic artifacts as a result of the synchronization procedure, and permits the screening of many cell types that may not be amenable to precise synchronization.'

aS'General acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase from pig liver mitochondria, which was prepared as a complex with C8CoA and mixed with electron-transfer flavoprotein, rapidly reduces the electron-transfer flavoprotein to a 1-electron-reduced form (anionic semiquinone). A second electron is transferred more slowly to form the fully reduced electron-transfer flavoprotein. Transfer of the first electron is faster than turnover in the dichlorophenolindophenol reduction assay. These observations show that the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase-electron-transfer flavoprotein system utilizes this semiquinone catalytically. A concomitant appearance of semiquinone from the general acyl-CoA dehydrogenase could not be detected under similar conditions.'

aS'Proteolysis of Nereis cuticle collagen by two bacterial collagenases was investigated using viscosimetry, enzyme kinetics, sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and ion exchange chromatography of collagenolytic peptides. Collagenase of the marine Vibrio B-30 completely degrades native cuticle collagen at 7 degress C with a turnover number 50 times greater than that of the clostridial collagenase. Although turnover numbers for the two enzymes are comparable when using denatured cuticle collagen as substrate, the vibrial collagenase appears to cleave twice as many peptide bonds per mg of cuticle collagen as does the clostridial enzyme. Sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis of collagenase-digested native cuticle collagen reflects the resistance of the collagen to clostridial collagenase; however, the vibrial enzyme completely degrades the cuticle collagen with the formation of one transient intermediate (Mr 400,000). Peptide analysis of fully digested denatured cuticle collagen reveals that the two enzymes have a number of qualitative and quantitative similarities. Despite these, however, only the vibrial collagenase seems capable of extensively degrading native cuticle collagen.'

aS'The transbilayer orientation of the oligosaccharide chain transferred from oligosaccharide-lipid to endogenous protein acceptors in sealed hen oviduct microsomes has been examined using endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H as a topological probe. The oligosaccharide moiety of these acceptors was released by the enzyme only under conditions where the microsomes were made permeable to macromolecules. The release of the oligosaccharide chain by endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H was not increased by removal of ribosomes or by mild trypsinization of the sealed microsomes. The endogenous acceptors were shown to be membrane-associated proteins that are not a part of the mRNA . ribosome . tRNA . nascent chain complex. From these results we conclude that the transfer of oligosaccharide from oligosaccharide-lipid occurs at the luminal face of the rough endoplasmic reticulum.'

aS'Isolated myocytes were prepared from adult canine hearts using a combined technique of myocardial perfusion followed by incubation with collagenase. More than 60% of the cells routinely excluded trypan blue dye. Disruption of the myocytes was accomplished using high pressure nitrogen cavitation. After differential and sucrose gradient centrifugation, the peak sarcolemmal fraction averaged 100-fold enrichment in ouabain-inhibited K+-stimulated p-nitrophenyl phosphatase and 82-fold in ouabain-inhibited (Na+,K+)-ATPase. These sarcolemmal membranes are enriched in phospholipid phosphorus (1.98 mumol/mg of protein) and more than 4-fold in sphingomyelin and cholesterol. Polyacrylamide gels revealed three major protein peaks at 50,000, 91,000, and 140,000 apparent molecular weights. This work demonstrates the feasibility of preparing highly pure cardiac sarcolemma from isolated adult myocytes. The problem of cellular cross-contamination due to heterogeneity of cell types in whole myocardial tissue has been circumvented. The level of enrichment exceeds all reported preparations of cardiac sarcolemma from whole myocardium and cultured myocytes. This preparation should prove to be useful as an in vitro model for studies of physiological, pharmacological, and pathological perturbations of sarcolemmal structure and function.'

aS'1. D-amino acid oxidase is inactivated by reaction with a low molar excess of dansyl chloride at pH 6.6, with complete inactivation accompanied by incorporation of 1.7 dansyl residues per mol of enzyme-bound flavin. The presence of benzoate, a potent competitive inhibitor, protects substantially against inactivation. Evidence is presented that the inactivation is due to dansylation of an active site histidine residue. Reactivation may be obtained by incubation with hydroxylamine. Diethylpyrocarbonate also inactivates the enzyme and modifies the labeling pattern with dansyl chloride. 2. Butanedione in the presence of borate reacts rapidly to inactivate D-amino acid oxidase. Reactivation is obtained spontaneously on removal of borate, implicating reaction of butanedione with an active site arginine residue. 3. Fluorodinitrobenzene appears to behave as an active site-directed reagent when mixed with D-amino acid oxidase at pH 7.4. Complete inactivation is obtained with incorporation of 2.0 dinitrophenyl residues per mol of enzyme-bound flavin. Again benzoate protects against inactivation; only one dinitrophenyl residue is incorporated in the presence of benzoate. The active site residue attacked by fluorodinitrobenzene has been identified as tyrosine.'

aS'Previous work has shown that the degradation of 20% of total protein which occurs early in germination of Bacillus megaterium spores is initiated by an endoprotease. This enzyme is found only in the spore and is active only on the spore proteins degraded during germination. Action of the spore protease in vitro on the three major proteins (Proteins A, B, and C) which are degraded in vivo during germination results in cleavage of one (A and C protein) or two (B protein) peptide bonds. The sequences surrounding the cleavage sites are -Tyr-Glu- Ile-Ala-Ser-Glu-Phe- in the A protein, -Phe-Glu- Ile-Ala-Ser-Glu-Phe- in the C protein, and -Thr-Glu- Phe-Gly-Ser-Glu-Thr-, and -Thr-Glu- Phe-Ala-Ser-Glu-Thr- in the B protein, with cleavage taking place at the glutamyl bond noted by the arrow. The similarity of these four sequences suggests the possibility that the specificity of the spore protease may be due to its requirement for a specific pentapeptide sequence of the type -R-Glu-(Phe or Ile)-(Gly or Ala)-Ser-Glu-R- for recognition and cleavage. However, it is also possible that it is the conformation of the A, B, and C proteins which determines their site of cleavage by the spore protease.'

aS'Two transport systems for serotonin were measured independently in osmotic lysates of porcine platelets. After pre-equilibration with potassium phosphate and dilution into NaCl medium, only the plasma membrane transport system was observed. Under these conditions, serotonin accumulation is inhibited by imipramine, but not by reserpine or norepinephrine, and requires high (100 meq/liter) concentrations of Na+. In the presence of ATP at low (10 meq/liter) concentrations of Na+, only the transport system of the intracellular serotonin storage organelles was observed. Under these conditions, transport is inhibited by reserpine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine, but not by imipramine, and requires either ATP or an artificially imposed pH gradient (interior acidic) across the organelle membrane. These and other results suggest that accumulation of serotonin in platelet storage organelles is coupled predominantly to the pH gradient across the membrane.'

aS'A 21-residue peptide analog of the Ca2+ binding Site 3 in rabbit skeletal troponin C has been synthesized by the solid phase method. CD studies as well as uv difference spectroscopy did not show any changes upon addition of Ca2+ to this peptide in aqueous solution. Acetylation of the NH2-terminal residue of the analog resulted in Ca2+-induced CD and uv difference spectral changes and these changes could be accentuated upon increasing the hydrophobicity of the solvent system. It was also found that the nonacetylated peptide showed Ca2+-induced changes in CD and uv difference spectroscopy when the studies were carried out in the hydrophobic solvent system. These results indicate that the complete helix-loop-helix unit is not required for Ca2+ binding to the loop region of the unit and that synthetic analogs can be prepared to determine the molecular requirements of the unit for metal ion affinity and selectivity. We describe the folding of this peptide about a calcium cation based on these preliminary results.'

aS'Elucidation of the complete amino acid sequence of rabbit skeletal beta-tropomyosin has shown that it has the same number of residues (284) per chain as the alpha component from the same source. The presence of more than one form of beta-tropomyosin was indicated by the detection of heterogeneity at 11 positions in the sequence. The ratio of the major form to the minor form(s) was estimated to be about 10:1. Of the 39 amino acid residue differences in the major alpha and beta forms, most involve chemically similar residues with only two leading to a more negative net charge on the beta form (Ser-229 to glutamic acid and His-276 to asparagine). These replacements do not significantly affect the repeating heptapeptide pattern of nonpolar and polar residues in tropomyosin nor the 14-fold periodicity of acidic and outer nonpolar residues implicated in its binding to F-actin. The larger number of substitutions in the COOH-terminal half of the protein is reflected in differences in the smoothed alpha-helix parameters of the beta-tropomyosin sequence when compared with that of the alpha component. These differences may be related to a lower binding affinity of beta-tropomyosin to troponin.'

aS'Synthetic repeat polypeptides analogous in sequence to the valine-rich regions of elastin have been tested as substrates for purified bovine aorta lysyl oxidase. These polypeptides, HCO(phi-Pro-Gly-Gly)n-Val-OMe, HCO(Val-Pro-Gly-phi-Gly)n-Val-OMe, and HCO-Val-(Ala-Pro-Gly-phi-Gly-Val)n-OMe, where phi = Val or Lys at approximately a 4:1 ratio and where n greater than or equal to 40, are models of the tetra-, penta-, or hexapeptide repeat sequences found in elastin. alpha-Aminoadipic delta-semialdehyde is generated in each of these upon incubation with lysyl oxidase at 37 degrees C, whereas the aldol and anhydrolysinonorleucine bifunctional cross-linkages were formed only in the incubation of enzyme with polypentapeptide. Incubation of the polypentapeptide at 55 degrees C, which enhances coacervation of the peptide, increases aldehyde formation and generates a much higher ratio of cross-linkages to aldehyde than occurred at 37 degrees C. These results demonstrate that lysyl oxidase can oxidize lysine in synthetic polypeptides and suggest important conformational aspects of lysyl oxidase substrates which may control substrate potential as well as the ability of peptidyl aldehyde, once formed by the enzyme, to condense to cross-linkage products.'

aS"To characterize further the active site of human placental estradiol 17 beta-dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.62), we have synthesized 2-bromoacetamidoestrone methyl ether. The affinity-labeling steroid is a substrate for the homogeneous enzyme. It inactivates the enzyme in a time-dependent, irreversible manner which follows pseudo-first order kinetics. Further, inactivation conducted with varying steroid concentration displays saturation kinetics. When 1.7 x 10(-6) M enzyme is inactivated by 2.6 x 10(-4) M 2-bromoacetamidoestrone methyl ether, the presence of an equimolar concentration of estradiol or 5.2 x 10(-4) M concentrations of NAD+, NADP+, or NADPH markedly slow the rate of inactivation. Bromoacetate (2.6 x 10(-4) M) does not inactivate the enzyme. After inactivation with 2-bromo[2'-14C]acetamidoestrone methyl ether, amino acid analysis reveals carboxymethylated derivatives of cysteine, histidine, and lysine containing 65, 25, and 8%, respectively, of the total incorporated carboxymethyl groups. The presence of estradiol, NADP+, or NADPH clearly inhibits alkylation of cysteinyl and histidyl residues and slows the rate of enzyme inactivation. Protection of these residues by both estradiol and NADPH suggests that they may actually be in the cofactor region of the active site, that this region is close to the steroid A-ring, and that binding of cofactor, by physical interposition, denies the reagent-bearing steroid access to these residues."

aS'We have reported previously that five different electrophoretic forms of mononucleosomes (MI to MV) are produced upon treatment of mammalian chromatin with micrococcal nuclease. We show here that each of these mononucleosome classes possesses internal heterogeneity due to the presence of a variety of minor protein species. Defined subsets of mononucleosome classes MII to MV have been reconstituted by reassociating stripped nucleosomes with histone H1 and non-histone protein HMG-17. This procedure leads to the generation of the same five major electrophoretic forms of mononucleosomes found in native chromatin. From the results of one- and two-dimensional electrophoretic analyses on reconstituted samples, it is concluded that different mononucleosome classes possess the following subunit structures: MI, core histone octamer (8-mer); MII, 8-mer plus one copy of HMG-17; MIIIA, 8-mer plus one copy of histone H1; MIIIB, 8-mer plus two copies of HMG-17; MIV, 8-mer plus one copy each of histone H1 and HMG-17; and MV, 8-mer plus one copy of histone H1 and two copies of HMG-17. Equal numbers of HMG-14 molecules can substitute for HMG-17 and generate the same nucleosome components. Thus, mononucleosomes possess independent binding sites for at least 1 histone H1 molecule and 2 nonhistone chromosomal protein molecules. We show further that reassociated HMG-17 molecules can exhibit a rapid interchange between binding sites, even under conditions of low ionic strength.'

aS"We have determined the entire sequence of two immunoglobulin kappa variable region genes derived separately from embryonic and plasmacytoma cells. Both genes are in the germline configuration; both are organized into hydrophobic leader and mature V-region coding sequences separated by a short intervening sequence. Both are identical with one another throughout the 1360 bases determined. In addition, there is a simple repeat sequence of 31 CA doublets that occurs about 300 bases from the 3' side of the coding sequence in each gene."

aS'When normal human blood lymphocytes are treated with mitogen in the presence of [3H]putrescine, label is incorporated into a few cellular proteins. Labeled N-(gamma-glutamyl) putrescine, N1-(gamma-glutamyl)spermidine, and N8-(gamma-glutamyl)spermidine were identified in exhaustive proteolytic digests of the cellular protein fraction. The enzyme-mediated clotting of rat seminal plasma to which 14C-labeled spermidine and spermine are added is accompanied by incorporation of the polyamines into a number of seminal plasma proteins. Proteolytic digests of the protein fraction from this clotted seminal plasma contain labeled N1-(gamma-glutamyl)spermidine, N8-(gamma-glutamyl)spermidine, N1,N8-bis(gamma-glutamyl)spermidine, N1-(gamma-glutamyl)spermine, and N1,N12-bis(gamma-glutamyl)spermine. These findings support a proposal that polyamines serve as substrates for transglutaminases both in cells and in an extracellular fluid. They show differences in cellular and extracellular substrate properties of the polyamines and indicate cross-linking through these amines in the extracellular system, but provide no evidence for such cross-linking in the cells.'

aS'The protein accumulated in the cell envelope of Escherichia coli treated with globomycin was identified as the precursor of the outer membrane lipoprotein. The prolipoprotein was almost exclusively localized in the cytoplasmic membrane. The prolipoprotein could be immunoprecipitated with antilipoprotein immunoglobulin and could be chased to the lipoprotein in both in vivo and in vitro. Globomycin inhibited the chase. The prolipoprotein contained glycerol and fatty acid residues, whereas no free sulfhydryl group was detected in it. From these results, it is concluded that the prolipoprotein possesses a glyceride which is covalently bound to the cysteine residue in the peptide as the lipoprotein does and that the removal of signal peptide takes place after the modification. The inhibition of bacterial growth with increasing concentrations of globomycin was accompanied by a gradual increase in the accumulation of the prolipoprotein. Furthermore, growth of the lipoprotein-negative mutant was highly resistant to globomycin. These results strongly indicate that the accumulation of the prolipoprotein in the cytoplasmic membrane causes the death of cells.'

The crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group P212121 with unit cell dimensions a = 52.99 A, b = 60.10 A, and c = 102.16 A.

aS'3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase from rat liver microsomes has been purified to apparent homogeneity with recoveries of approximately 50%. The enzyme obtained from rats fed a diet supplemented with cholestyramine had specific activities of approximately 21,500 nmol of NADPH oxidized/min/mg of protein. After amino acid analysis a specific activity of 31,000 nmol of NADPH oxidized/min/mg of amino acyl mass was obtained. The s20,w for HMG-CoA reductase was 6.14 S and the Stokes radius was .39 nm. The molecular weight of the enzyme was 104,000 and the enzyme subunit after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was 52,000. Antibodies prepared against the homogeneous enzyme specifically precipitated HMG-CoA reductase from crude and pure fractions of the enzyme. Incubation of rat hepatocytes for 3 h in the presence of lecithin dispersions, compactin, or rat serum resulted in significant increases in the specific activity of the microsomal bound reductase. Immunotitrations indicated that in all cases these increases were associated with an activated form of the reductase. However activation of the enzyme accounted for only a small percentage of the total increase in enzyme activity; the vast majority of the increase was apparently due to an increase in the number of enzyme molecules. In contrast, when hepatocytes were incubated with mevalonolactone the lower enzyme activity which resulted was primarily due to inactivation of the enzyme with little change in the number of enzyme molecules. Immunotitrations of microsomes obtained from rats killed at the nadir or peak of the diurnal rhythm of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase indicated that the rhythm results both from enzyme activation and an increased number of reductase molecules.'

aS'The effect of different divalent metal ions on the hydrolysis of DNA by DNase I was studied with an assay which distinguishes between cleavage of one or both strands of the DNA substrate during initial encounters between enzyme and DNA. Using covalently closed superhelical SV40(I) DNA as substrate, initial reaction products consisting of relaxed circles or unit-length linears are resolved by electrophoresis of radioactively labeled DNA in agarose gels. Only in the presence of a transition metal ion, such as Mn2+ or Co2+, and only under certain reaction conditions, is DNase I able to cut both DNA strands at or near the same point, generating unit-length linears. This ability to cut both DNA strands is inhibited by such factors as temperature decrease, the addition of a monovalent ion or another divalent cation which is not a transition metal ion, or a reduction in the number of superhelical turns in the DNA substrate. All of these factors lead to a winding of the duplex helix and antagonize the unwinding of the duplex promoted by transition metal ion binding. Transition metal ions may thus convert the DNA substrate locally to a form in which DNase I can introduce breaks into both strands. In the presence of Mg2+, DNase I introduces single strand nicks into SV40(I), generating exclusively the covalently open, relaxed circular SV40(II) as the initial product of the reaction. In the presence of Mn2+, DNase I generates as initial products a mixture of SV40(II) and unit-length SV40 linear DNA molecules, formed by two nicks in opposite strands at or near the same point in the duplex. These circular SV40(II) molecules consist of two types. A minority class is indistinguishable from the nicked SV40(II) produced by DNase I in the presence of Mg2+. The majority class consists of molecules containing a gap in one of the two strands, the mean length of the gap being 11 nucleotides. The SV40(L) molecules produced in the presence of Mn2+ appear to have single strand extensions at one or both ends.'

aS'Bovine liver mitochondria have been found to contain an enzyme which will catalyze the formation of delta-aminolevulinic acid via a transamination reaction rather than via the condensation of glycine and succinyl coenzyme A. The enzyme, L-alanine: gamma,delta-dioxovaleric acid aminotransferase (gamma,delta-dioxovalerate transaminase) was isolated and purifed to apparent homogeneity. gamma,delta-Dioxovalerate transaminase is quite stable, has optimal activity at pH 6.9, requires pyridoxal phosphate as a cofactor and has an apparent molecular weight of 240,000. The enzyme has high specificity for both substrates. The Km for L-alanine is 3.7 x 10(-3) M and the Km for gamma,delta-dioxovalerate is 2.4 x 10(-4) M. Plots of 1/gamma,delta-dioxovalerate against 1/v at varying alanine concentrations suggested a ping-pong reaction mechanism. Although the enzyme appeared to be a typical transaminase, exhaustive experiments failed to demonstrate reversibility of the reaction. The capacity of gamma,delta-dioxovalerate transaminase to synthesize delta-aminolevulinic acid appears to be far greater than the capacity of delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase from the same source. The possibility that gamma,delta-dioxovalerate transaminase plays a role in the biosynthesis of delta-aminolevulinic acid in vivo must be considered.'

aS"A guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cGMP)-dependent protein kinase was purified from bovine lung using 8-(6-aminohexylamino)-cAMP-Sepharose. The activity of the purified enzyme was highly dependent on cGMP using histone f2b as a substrate. The self-phosphorylation of the purified enzyme was strongly inhibited by cGMP and not significantly affected by cAMP. A precipitating antiserum prepared in rabbits against the cGMP-dependent protein kinase specifically inhibited the histone kinase activity and the self-phosphorylation of the purified cGMP-dependent protein kinase without affecting the cGMP binding site. This antiserum also specifically inhibited the phosphorylation of the endogenous substrate proteins by endogenous cGMP-dependent protein kinase in smooth muscle membranes, but did not cross-react detectably with catalytic subunit or regulatory subunit of type I or type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Conversely, anti-sera against the regulatory subunit of type I or type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase did not cross-react detectably with cGMP-dependent protein kinase. The substantial differences between the immunological properties of the cGMP-dependent and cAMP-dependent protein kinases suggest that these two enzymes have distinct physiological roles."

aS"The specificity of transcription of Euglena gracilis Z chloroplast DNA by chloroplast DNA-dependent RNA polymerase in a transcriptionally active chromosome (Hallick, R.B., Lipper, C., Richards, O.C., and Rutter, W.J. (1976) Biochemistry 15, 3039-3045) has been studied. RNA molecules are both initiated and elongated in vitro. The RNA transcripts have been characterized as to their size, nuclease sensitivity, 5'-terminal oligonucleotides, and coding locus on the chloroplast genome. RNA labeled in vitro at the 5' end with [gamma-32P]ATP was digested with RNase T1, RNase A, and S1 nuclease. The resulting 5'-gamma-32P-oligonucleotides were fractionated by gel electrophoresis. In each case, one or two discrete products were obtained, consistent with initiation in vitro only at defined loci. RNA labeled in vitro with [alpha-32P]ATP or CTP has been hybridized to Southern (Southern, E.M. (1975) J. Mol. Biol. 98, 503-517) transfers of restriction endonuclease fragments of chloroplast DNA. The most abundant in vitro transcripts hybridize to chloroplast DNA fragments coding for 23 S, 16 S, and 5 S rRNAs. Only the coding strands of the rRNA genes are transcribed. Non-rDNA sequences of chloroplast DNA are also selectively transcribed but at much lower levels. The transcriptionally active chromosome has proved to be an ideal biochemical preparation for the study of selective transcription of cell organelle DNA."

aS'Three anticoagulant proteins were isolated from the venom of Naja nigricollis (spitting cobra). The peaks of anticoagulant activity co-chromatographed with phospholipase A2 activities. The three proteins were homogeneous by the criteria of electrophoresis in two acidic polyacrylamide gel systems. Electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate also yielded single protein bands with molecular weights of about 15,000. The amino acid compositions of the three anticoagulant proteins are reported. All three proteins have only one amino acid replacement in the first 25 to 30 amino acids of their NH2-terminal sequences, compared to the sequence of the basic phospholipase from N. nigricollis venom. Removal of Ca2+ from the crude venom caused loss of both anticoagulant and phospholipase activities, and restoration of Ca2+ caused partial recovery of both activities. Both activities were lost in parallel when the venom was heated between pH 6.0 and 8.5. The association of the anticoagulant effect with phospholipase activity contradicts the previous conclusion that phospholipase is not responsible for the anticoagulant action of cobra venom. The previous results might be explained by independence of the anticoagulant and phospholipase effects within the same protein molecule, or by different activity levels of monomer and dimer forms of the enzyme.'

Remarkably, no cell line contained an intact distal portion of the early gene region which encodes a portion of the large T antigen. All cell lines examined contained the PY DNA Bum I fragment which contains most of the genetic information encoding PY small and middle T antigens, as well as the origin of viral DNA replication. These results provide an explanation for our previous observation that PY virus-induced hamster tumors do not contain the large species of T antigen.'

aS'Crystals of troponin-C from rabbit and chicken muscles have been obtained using the vapor diffusion method. Crystals of rabbit troponin-C are tetragonal with a unit cell of a = b = 89.4 A, c = 79.9 A, space group P42, and 4 molecules/asymmetric unit. Diffraction from these crystals is limited to 7A and the crystals are unstable under x-ray irradiation, making them unsuitable for a high resolution structural determination. Crystals of chicken troponin-C are trigonal with a unit cell of a = b = 66.7 A, c = 60.8 A. The space group is P3121 or P3221 and there is only 1 molecule/asymmetric unit. These crystals diffract to at least 2.2 A, are very stable under x-ray irradiation, and are suitable for high resolution study.'

aS'Plasmid-borne resistance to sulfonamides was studied in both newly isolated and earlier characterized R plasmids. Two different classes of drug-resistant dihydropteroate synthases were found to be responsible for most cases of plasmid-mediated sulfonamide resistance. The plasmid-coded enzymes could be completely separated from their chromosomal counterpart and also showed differences in heat stability and molecular size. The resistant and chromosomal enzymes could bind the normal substrate, p-aminobenzoic acid, with equal efficiency. In contrast, sulfonamide binding was about 10,000 times lower with the plasmid-coded enzymes than with the chromosomal enzyme. Another substrate analog, p-aminosalicylic acid, on the other hand, inhibited chromosomal and plasmid-mediated enzymes to a similar extent. Evidence was also found for the existence of a plasmid-borne resistance mechanism independent of drug-insensitive enzymes.'

aS'R plasmid R68.45 was transferred in broth matings from Escherichia coli to strains of Erwinia amylovora, E. carotovora subsp. atroseptica, E. chrysanthemi, and E. herbicola (Enterobacter agglomerans); the frequency of transfer ranged from 2 x 10(-8) to 5 x 10(-4) per input donor cell depending on the bacterial species. The drug resistance markers tet(+), amp(+), and kan(+) were stable in these Erwinia species. Transconjugants of Erwinia spp., but not of the wild-type parent Erwinia strains, acquired levels of antibiotic resistance (tetracycline, 50 mug/ml; ampicillin, 200 mug/ml; kanamycin 200 mug/ml) similar to those of the donor R68.45-bearing strain of Escherichia coli. Erwinia transconjugants (with one exception of E. carotovora subsp. atroseptica) were donors of the antibiotic resistance markers; the frequency of transfer was consistently higher with an E. coli strain than with Erwinia spp. as recipients, and when matings were done on a solid surface (membranes) rather than in liquid. Transfer of chromosomal markers ade(+), gal(+), gtu(+) (utilization of galacturonate), his(+), leu(+), lys(+), thr(+), and trp(+) occurred in crosses between E. chrysanthemi strains harboring R68.45 and appropriate recipient strains; the frequency of transfer ranged from 9.0 x 10(-8) to 2.0 x 10(-6) depending on the selective marker. Analysis of the coinheritance of unselected markers among various classes of recombinants revealed linkage between thr-leu-lys-ade and between trp and his, thus confirming earlier findings with the Hfr-type donor cells. Since R68.45 mobilized an array of chromosomal markers in the wild-type as well as genetically marked strains of E. chrysanthemi, the system, used in conjunction with the existing Hfr strains, should provide a useful tool to study the genetics of plant pathogenicity of this bacterial species. In contrast to E. chrysanthemi, R68.45 did not mobilize chromosomal markers ilv(+), his(+), rbs(+), ser(+), and thr(+) in E. amylovora EA178.'

aS"Most strains of Escherichia coli K-12 are unable to use the enzyme IIA/IIB (enzyme IIMan) complex of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) in anaerobic growth and therefore cannot utilize glucosamine anaerobically. Introduction into these strains of a ptsG mutation, which eliminates activity of the enzyme IIIGlc/IIB' complex of the PTS, resulted in inability to grow anaerobically on glucose and mannose. Derivative strains able to grow anaerobically on glucosamine had mutations at a locus close to man, the gene coding for phosphomannose isomerase, and had higher enzyme IIA/IIB activities during anaerobic growth than did the parental strain. These results establish a locus affecting function of enzyme IIA/IIB that maps distant from ptsM, the probable structural gene for enzyme IIB."

aS'In this paper we describe the successful isolation of glyT-derived GAA suppressors. A glyT+ strain containing glyV55, the gene for a GGA/G-reading, methane sulfonate and hydroxylamine. The cells were plated to select for reversal of auxotrophy due to a trpA(GAA211) mutation. With either mutagen, greater than 85% of the prototrophs obtained were due to suppressors of the trpA mutation. Approximately 12% of the ethyl methane sulfonate-induced and 37% of the hydroxylamine-induced suppressors were shown to be about 25% cotranscucible with metB, as is glyT. The transfer ribonucleic acid from four metB-linked suppressor strains (two from each mutagen) was examined by reversed-phase column (RPC-5) chromatography. In all four cases, the glycyl-transfer ribonucleic acid profile displayed an alteration of glyT transfer ribonucleic acid. All four suppressors responded to GAG in addition to GAA but did not suppress the known mutant codons of several other trpA mutants. Other properties are discussed, along with possible reasons for our success in obtaining these suppressors.'

aS'Hydrogenases were measured in intact actinorhizal root nodules and from disrupted nodules of Alnus glutinosa, Alnus rhombifolia, Alnus rubra, and Myrica pensylvanica. Whole nodules took up H2 in an O2-dependent reaction. Endophyte preparations oxidized H2 through the oxyhydrogen reaction, but rates were enhanced when hydrogen uptake was coupled to artificial electron acceptors. Oxygen inhibited artifical acceptor-dependent H2 uptake. The hydrogenase system from M. pensylvanica had a different pattern of coupling to various electron acceptors than the hydrogenase systems from the alders; only the bayberry system evolved H2 from reduced viologen dyes.'

aS'Plasmid Rms312, specifying resistance to tetracycline (Tc), chloramphenicol (Cm), streptomycin (Sm), sulfonamide (Su), and mercury chloride (Mer), deletes both Tc and Cm Sm Su Mer determinants at a high frequency in Salmonella typhimurium LT2. S. typhimurium mutants that were stable carriers of Rms312 were isolated by alternate culture of R-bearing cells in a medium containing either tetracycline or chloramphenicol. In one of these mutants the deletion frequency of drug resistance determinants was decreased by about 100-fold not only Rms312, but also in R100, R1, and R6-5. This mutation caused a slight reduction of ultraviolet resistance but did not affect generalized genetic recombination, indicating that the mutation is different from recA. The mutation, designated dor (deletion of r-determinants), was mapped to a position near 57 units in the new linkage map of S. typhimurijm LT2 (K. E. Sanderson and P. E. Hartman, Microbiol. Rev. 42:471-519, 1978). The dor mutation had no effect on IS1-mediated illegitimate deletion, indicating that the dor mutation is different from the del mutation described by Nevers and Saedler (P.

aS'The pathogenic species of Cryptococcus, C. neoformans and C. bacillisporus, utilized creatinine as a source of nitrogen but not of carbon. Chromatographic and autoradiographic studies suggest that creatinine metabolism in both species involves a single step resulting in the production of methylhydantoin and ammonia. The enzyme responsible for this step, creatinine deiminase, was produced by the cells only in the presence of creatinine in both species. The synthesis of creatinine deiminase was repressed by ammonia in C. neoformans, but not in C. bacillisporus. A possible explanation for this variation, based on the ecological differences between the two species, is discussed. A novel method for measuring creatinine deiminase activity is also described.'

aS'Mutants of Escherichia coli resistant to the antibiotic clorobiocin are also coumermycin resistant, and the mutation to resistance in at least one mutant was mapped near gyrB. We conclude, therefore, that clorobiocin inhibits deoxyribonucleic acid gyrase, and the drug was used to probe the role of this enzyme in vivo. Deozyribonucleic acid synthesis was preferentially inhibited but not completely blocked by the antibiotic. Transcription and cell division were also markedly affected. However, unlike other inhibitors of deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis, clorobiocin failed to induce the synthesis of protein X, the recA gene product. In mutants resistant to clorobiocin the replication velocity was unaffected, but initiation of deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis appeared to be delayed. We conclude that deoxyribonucleic acid gyrase, and hence the supercoiled structure of the chromosome, is important for transcription, normal initiation of deoxyribonucleic acid replication, and cell division. The possible role of deoxyribonucleic acid gyrase in the elongation of replication forks is also discussed.'

aS'A new class of colicin M-tolerant mutants of Escherichia coli K-12 was isolated. The mutants exhibited an unusually high tolerance in that they were unaffected by colicin titers of 10(6). The tolerance was confined to colicin M. It was mapped at a locus called tolM, which is close to rpsL. The following gene order was determined: aroE, tolM, rpsL, cysG. The tolerance could be caused by a defect in the uptake of colicin M or by a mutation at the site of action. Insensitive tonA and tonB mutants became sensitive to colicin M upon treatment by osmotic shock, whereas the tolM mutants remained insensitive. Trypsin rescue experiments showed that the tonB-dependent uptake of colicin M required energy like the other tonB-related transport processes. When bound to energy-depleted cells, colicin M prevented adsorption of phage T5. The receptor became accessible to the phage when the cells were energized, except in tonB mutants. These data suggest that the function controlled by the tonB gene is required for the translocation of colicin M from its initial binding site at the tonA-coded receptor protein to the target.'

aS'Vitreoscilla, a gliding bacterium in the Beggiatoaceae, is an obligate aerobe in which cytochrome o functions as the terminal oxidase. Protoheme IX is the only heme type present in this organism. The yield and heme content of Vitreoscilla cells grown in yeast extract, peptone, and acetate were dependent on growth conditions. Cells harvested in early stationary phase contained roughly three times as much heme as cells in early log phase. There was an optimal shaking rate for maximum heme content of cells harvested in stationary phase at fixed initial nutrient concentration. The heme content of cells grown at a fixed shaking rate increased from 5 nmol/g (wet weight) in media which had low nutrient concentration to a maximum of 45 nmol/g (wet weight) in media which had high nutrient concentration, and there was a corresponding sixfold increase in cytochrome o content and an eightfold increase in respiratory rate, evidence that some of the additional heme was incorporated into respiratory pigments. Heme content may be controlled jointly by competition for oxygen and availability of nutrients. Temperature and initial pH affected the growth rate but not the final yield or heme content. Growth rate was optimal at pH 8.0 to 8.5. A defined medium for Vitreoscilla, which is based on glutamate as the carbon source, is described; the other organic components of this medium are acetate, tryptophan, thiamine, biotin, and riboflavin.'

aS'The genes dsdA, dsdO, and dsdC have been located on a 3.0-kilobase pair (kb) fragment of the Escherichia coli chromosome by a combination of techniques. The loci were first cloned onto lambda and various plasmid vectors. dsd hybrid plasmids were then digested with restriction enzymes, and the fragments were recloned to test for the presence of dsdC or dsdA. In one case, a 4.2-kb restriction fragment containing the dsdA operon was used to form a heteroduplex with a well-defined lambda dsd deoxyribonucleic acid. The results show that dsdA, dsdO, and at least 0.6 kb of dsdC are present on this piece of deoxyribonucleic acid. On the basis of the mapping analysis and the molecular weight of D-serine deaminase, 1.9 kb of the 4.2-kb fragment is accounted for by the three dsd loci. We conclude that dsdO and dsdC are contiguous. A detailed dsd restriction map is presented.'

aS'In the D-serine deaminase system of Escherichia coli, which is regulated by positive control, we have fouand a complete lack of trans activation in vivo with multicopy dsd hybrid plasmids. A PLASmid carrying the regulatory gene, dsdC+, did not promote expression of chromosomal dsdCO+A+ loci, nor did a chromosomal dsdC+ gene promote expression of plasmid-borne dsdC delta O+A+ (dsd regulatory gene negative) restriction fragments. However, hybrid plasmids that comprise the entire dsd system (dsdC+O+A+) are highly inducible for the enzyme. These dsd hybrid plasmid deoxyribonucleic acids functioned well as templates in the in vitro coupled transcription-translation system. In vitro-synthesized dsdC+ protein promoted expression of the dsdA+ operation efficiently. Exogenously purified dsdC+ protein also activated expression of several dsdC delta O+A+ plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid templates in vitro. An explanation that reconciles these results with previous dominance studies is presented.'

aS'It has been observed previously that the mutagenic action of nitrous acid may be potentiated by polyamines. We examined the cellular response of two deoxyribonucleic acid repair systems to treatment with spermidine-nitrite reaction products. uvrB- deficient mutants of Salmonella typhimurium LT2 showed enhanced lethal and mutagenic response to the reaction products. Lethal activity was further enhanced in a uvrB recA double mutant, whereas mutagenic activity was not detectable. Dependence of mutagenesis on the recA gene implicates the action of an error-prone repair system in the fixation of a premutagenic lesion as a mutation. From consideration of the substrate characteristics of the two repair systems studied, it is suggested that the deoxyribonucleic acid lesion formed by the reaction products of spermidine and nitrite is an intrastrand cross-link.'

aS'The intracellular level of S-adenosylmethionine increased as the yeast-phase cells of Mucor racemosus were induced to convert to hyphae. This increase correlated well with time course of the conversion in cell type and was independent of the metabolic changes caused by the shift to aerobic conditions. There was no significant change in the intracellular level of spermidine, a polyamine synthesized from putrescine and the propylamine group of S-adenosylmethionine. Spermine was not detected. An examination of protein methylation revealed an increase in the methylation of total protein during the shift in cell type and possible qualitative as well as quantitative changes in specific base proteins.'

aS'Three strains of Escherichia coli B auxotrophic for leucine, guanine, or uracil were analyzed after exhaustion of the respective required nutrient from the growth medium. The pattern of transcription was analyzed by ribonucleic acid-deoxyribonucleic acid filter hybridization to specific deoxyribonucleic acid probes, and the pattern of translation was analyzed by autoradiography after the resolution of proteins on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The results obtained suggest the following conclusions. (i) Specific regulation of rpoBC transcription occurs at both the promoter (PL10) and the putative attenuator between rplL and rpoB. (ii) The stringent response of ribosomal protein gene expression to amino acid insufficiency is only partially mimicked by purine or pyrimidine insufficiency. (iii) Transcription initiation at PL10 decreases in response to guanine exhaustion, but in contrast increases significantly in response to uracil exhaustion. (iv) The expression of the induced lac operon is severely depressed during any of these exhaustions. These conclusions argue against simple models for regulation of ribonucleic acid polymerase production or promoter choice by the intracellular levels of its substrate nucleotides.'

aS'Constitutive synthesis of enzymes responsible for methyl group oxidation in 3,5-xylenol degradation and an associated p-cresol methylhydroxylase in Pseudomonas putida NCIB 9869 was shown by their retention at high specific activities in cells transferred from 3,5-xylenol medium to glutamate medium. The specific activities of other enzymes of the 3,5-xylenol pathway declined upon removal of aromatic substrate, consistent with their inducible control. Specific activities of the methyl-oxidizing enzymes showed an eventual decline concomitant with a decrease in the fraction of bacteria capable of growth with 3,5-xylenol; a simultaneous loss of the ability to grow with m-hydroxybenzoate was also observed. The property of 3,5-xylenol utilization could be transferred to another strain of P. putida. It is proposed that enzymes of the 3,5-xylenol pathway and those for conversion of p-cresol to p-hydroxybenzoate are plasmid encoded, that the early methyl-oxidizing enzymes are expressed constitutively, and that the later enzymes are inducible.'

aS'Genetic experiments have indicated that asparagine auxotrophs of Escherichias coli K-12 can be made asparagine prototrophs at either of two sites on the chromosome and that wild-type strains require both sites to be mutated to produce asparagine auxotrophy. The former asn locus is now called asnA, and the new gene is designated asnB. The asnB gene is located near gal.AsnA+ asnB and asnA asnB+ strains were constructed, and the asparagine synthetic reaction was characterized in extracts. These studies revealed that the asnA gene codes for the enzyme previously described (H. Cedar and J.H. Schwartz, J. Biol. Chem. 244: 4112-4121, 1969), whereas the asnB gene is involved in the production of an enzyme which differs from the one previously described in its specific activity in extracts, its stability at low and high temperatures, and its apparent ability to use either glutamine or ammonia as amide nitrogen donor. Physiological studies showed that either enzyme alone is sufficient to allow a maximal growth rate under conditions of asparagine limitation.'

aS'Escherichia coli K-12 has two genes, asnA+ and asnB+, either one of which is able to satisfy the need of cells for asparagine. In order for a strain to have an auxotrophic requirement for asparagine, both genes must be mutationally inactivated. We obtained mutants with Tn5 inserted in asnB. asnB was mapped by conjugation and by three-factor P1 transductions at 15 min on the E coli K-12 linkage map, between ubiF and nagB. Specialized transducing phage lamba 781 supE was shown to carry asnB, as well as supE, ubiF, nagA, and nagB. asnA is the previously mapped ilv-linked asn locus, whiich is between uncB and rbs. E. coli C also has two asn genes, corresponding to asnA and asnB.'

aS'Glucosylated and nonglucosylated bacteriophage T4 deoxyribonucleic acids (DNAs) are able to bind to competent cells of Bacillus subtilis, although the former does so in a rather unstable fashion, probably because of the glucosylation. Several heterologous DNAs compete with homologous DNA for the same receptors in binding and in transformation. A different pattern in competition for DNA binding was observed for homologous and T4 glucosylated DNAs in intact cells as compared with protoplasts or membrane vesicles. The results are consistent with the existence of two types of receptor sites on the membrane of competent B. subtilis cells.'

aS'Initiation and termination of chromosome replication in an Escherichia coli auxotroph subjected to amino acid starvation were examined by following the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into the EcoRI restriction fragments of the chromosome. The pattern of incorporation observed upon restoration of the amino acid showed that starvation blocks the process of initiation prior to deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis within any significant portion of the EcoRI fragment which contains the origin of replication, oriC. In this experiment, no incorporation of [3H]thymidine into EcoRI fragments from the terminus of replication was observed, nor was it found when a dnaC initiation mutant was used to prevent incorporation at the origin which might have obscured labeling of terminus fragments. Thus amino acid starvation does not appear to block replication forks shortly before termination of replication. Attempted synchronization of replication initiation by including a period of thymine starvation subsequent to the amino acid starvation led to simultaneous incorporation of [3H]-thymidine into all EcoRI fragments within the 240-kilobase region that surrounds oriC. It is shown that the thymine starvation step allowed initiation and a variable, but limited, amount of replication to occur.'

aS'Fast-growing species of Rhizobium were found to secrete low-molecular-weight beta-2-linked glucans when cultured in synthetic liquid medium. These glucans are quite similar to beta-2-linked glucans produced by species of Agrobacterium. No reducing terminus was detected in these glucans.'

aS'A deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-dependent DNA polymerase (DNA nucleotidyltransferase) was purified 3,000-fold from the marine Pseuodomonas sp. BAL-31. The molecular weight of the native enzyme was estimated by glycerol gradient sedimentation to be 110,000. The enzyme migrated in sodium dodecyl sulfate-acrylamide gels as a single polypeptide with a molecular weight of 105,000. An absolute requirement for divalent cation was satisfied by Mg2+ or Mn2+ at concentrations of 1 mM. Monovalent cations at concentrations higher than 50 mM showed an inhibitory effect. The polymerase activity was resistant to N-ethylmaleimide and showed a wide pH optimum.'

aS'In Bacillus subtilis the deoxyribonucleic acid content and the extent of cell division during inhibition of chromosome replication increased as a function of the average cell mass, independent of the growth rate. At each growth rate, mass, deoxyribonucleic acid, and residual division varied in different cultures. The variation is consistent with a large variability in the D period. At growth rates higher than 1.5 doublings per h at 37 degrees C, the change in D accounts for the growth rate dependence of the mass and deoxyribonucleic acid content.'

aS"Cytidine 5'-diphospho (CDP)-1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol (CDPdiacylglycerol):sn-glycerol-3-phosphate phosphatidyltransferase (EC 2.7.8.5, phosphatidylglycero-P synthase) and CDPdiacylglycerol:L-serine O-phosphatidyltransferase (EC 2.7.8.8, phosphatidylserine synthase) activities were identified in the cell envelope fraction of the gram-positive anaerobe Clostridium perfringens. The association of phosphatidylglycero-P synthase and phosphatidylserine synthase with the cell envelope fraction of cell-free extracts was demonstrated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, by both activities sedimenting with the 100,000 x g pellet and solubilization of both activities from the 100,000 x g pellet with Triton X-100. The pH optimum for both enzyme activities was 8.0 with tris(hydroxy-methyl)aminomethane-hydrochloride buffer. Phosphatidylglycero-P synthase activity was dependent on magnesium ions (100 mM). Phosphatidylserine synthase activity was dependent on manganese (0.1 mM) or magnesium ions (50 mM). Both enzyme activities were dependent on the addition of the nonionic detergent Triton X-100. Maximum phosphatidylglycero-P synthase and phosphatidylserine synthase activities were obtained when the molar ratio of Triton X-100 to CDP-diacylglycerol was 50:1 and 12:1, respectively. The Km for sn-glycero-3-P in the phosphatidylglycero-P synthase reaction was 0.1 mM. The Km for L-serine in the phosphatidylserine synthase reaction was 0.15 mM. Both enzyme activities were 100% stable for at least 20 min at 60 degrees C."

aS'Treatment with picolinic acid blocked Neurospora crassa nuclei in G1, and recovery from the treatment allowed a synchronous wave of deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis to occur. Nuclei, which appeared as compact globular bodies during the period of blockage, assumed a ring shape during the following S phase, which was also maintained in the G2 phase. The proportion of compact globular nuclei was much higher in hyphae growing at lower rates, whereas that of ring nuclei increased when the hyphae were growing at higher rates. Horseshoe nuclei (probably mitotic nuclei) and double ring nuclei were also observed in growing hyphae, but their frequencies were low and fairly independent of the rate of growth. The length of the S phase of the Neurospora nuclear division cycle was determined to be about 30 min. From the frequencies of the phase-specific nuclear shapes, the durations of the G1 phase and the combined S plus G2 phases were calculated. The results showed that variations in the growth rates of the mycelia were mainly coupled with variations in the G1 phase of the nuclear division cycle. For mycelia growing in minimal sucrose, the lengths of all of the phases of the nuclear division cycle were estimated.'

aS'The polypeptide composition of the functional porin trimers that produced the permeability channels in the outer membrane of Salmonella typhimurium was examined on two-dimensional slab gels. The results suggested that the majority of porin trimers from strains producing mixed species of porin polypeptides consisted of homologous subunit polypeptides. The present results do not exclude the possibility that a small fraction of porin trimer is constructed from heterologous subunit polypeptides.'

aS'The sexually agglutinative yeast Hansenula wingei lives in association with bark beetles that inhabit coniferous trees. This yeast was induced to sporulate by malt extract, which contains a high percentage of maltose (50%) and a low percentage of nitrogen (0.5%). A solution of 1.5% maltose without any growth factors also induced ascosporogenesis in H. wingei. Thus, only a carbon source is required for sporulation as in Saccharomyces. However, potassium acetate did not induce sporulation in H. wingei as it does in S. cerevisiae. Instead, disaccharides (such as maltose, sucrose, or cellobiose) promote sporulation better than either monosaccharides (such as dextrose, fructose, or mannose) or respiratory substrates (such as ethanol or glycerol). The specificity of disaccharides in promoting sporulation in H. wingei may be considered an adaptation since these disaccharides are present in the natural environment of this yeast. In addition, the specificity of disaccharides may be related to the induction of the disaccharidase because cells precultured on dextrose sporulate well on maltose, but cells precultured on maltose sporulate poorly on maltose. When (NH(4))(2)SO(4) was added at a low concentration (3 mM) to synthetic sporulation medium (1.5% maltose solution), sporulation was abolished, whereas other salts and nitrogen sources inhibited to a lesser extent and vitamins and trace elements had no effect. Oxygen was required for sporulation, as expected for an obligate aerobe. Maximal sporulation was achieved in 2% malt extract broth at high cell density (10(9) cells per ml), pH 5, and 25 degrees C. By using these optimal physiological conditions and hybrid strains selected from an extensive genetic breeding program, about 30% asci (10% tetrads) were obtained routinely. Thus, the genetics of cell recognition in this yeast can now be studied.'

aS'The traT protein (TraTp) of the F sex factor is the product of one of the two genes involved in surface exclusion. Several detergents were examined under different conditions in order to determine their ability to solubilize TraTp from membrane vesicles. These experiments showed that TraTp behaved similar to a number of peptidoglycan-associated outer membrane proteins and that it existed in multimeric aggregates within the membrane. However, unlike other major outer membrane proteins, the amount of TraTp incorporated into the membrane was not affected by lipopolysaccharide-deficient mutants, even when mutants totally lacking the neutral sugars in their lipopolysaccharide backbone were used. TraTp wqs also examined by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, where it ran as a discrete spot with a very basic isoelectric point. By coupling cyanogen bromide-activated dextran onto whole cells and by labeling whole cells with 125I (via lactoperoxidase), it was shown that TraTp was exposed on the cell surface. TraTp in a membrane environment was also insensitive to proteolytic attack by trypsin.'

aS"Vesicles prepared from iron-grown Thiobacillus ferrooxidans, and subsequently loaded with adenosine 5'-diphosphate and inorganic phosphate, produced adenosine 5'-triphosphate when subjected to H+ gradients comparable to those in the cells' normal environment (i.e., an internal pH in the range of 6.0 to 8.0 with an optimum of 7.0 to 7.8 and an external pH in the range of 2.1 to 4.1 with an optimum of 2.8). Nigericin, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, and pentachlorophenol decreased adenosine 5'-triphosphate synthesis. Valinomycin at concentrations of 2.5 and 5.0 micrograms/ml increased adenosine 5'-triphosphate formation by 25 and 30%, respectively."

aS'Optical diffraction and computer image processing of electron micrographs were employed to analyze the structure of the regular surface layer of Sporosarcina ureae at high resolution. Negatively stained preparations of regular surface layer fragments showed two types of tetragonal pattern, each having p4 symmetry in projection with a = 12.8 nm. Although the two patterns differed greatly in overall appearance, both had a common pattern of areas of high stain density which we interpret as arising from gaps or holes in the structure. We speculate that these holes may be related to a protective role of the regular surface layer, whereby hostile environmental agents (such as muramidases) larger than about 2 nm would be screened from the underlying layers of the bacterial surface, while the free passage of nutrients and waste products into and out of the cell would still be allowed.'

aS'The spectral dependence of phycoerythrin synthesis has been studied in a unicellular photautotrophic cyanobacterium, Synechocystis sp. 6701, in which phycoerythrin synthesis alone is under chromatic control. Cells were partially depleted of their phycobiliprotein pigments through nitrate starvation in the light. Addition of nitrate to the culture medium allowed synthesis of phycobiliproteins in the dark. This synthesis occurred at the expense of the glycogen reserve accumulated during the period of nitrate starvation. Monochromatic irradiations of short duration at lambda less than 590 nm induced increased phycoerythrin synthesis during dark incubation. Monochromatic irradiations of short duration at lambda greater than 590 nm prevented this synthesis. These effects were photoreversible. The spectral distribution showed a maximum at 540 nm for the potentiation of phycoerythrin synthesis, and one at 640 nm for its photoreversal.'

The level of catalase, peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase in cell-free extracts of the strains as well as the capacity of intact cells to decompose hydrogen peroxide were assayed, recA strains were more rapidly killed than other strains with deoxyribonucleic acid repair deficiencies. There was no correlation between the killing rate of the strains and the capacity of intact cells to decompose hydrogen peroxide or the level of catalase and superoxide dismutase in cell-free extracts. The level of peroxidase in cell-free extract was too low to be determined.'

aS'A fragment of deoxyribonucleic acid 5,300 base paris long and containing the promoter-proximal portion of the histidine operon of Escherichia coli K-12, has been cloned in plasmid pBR313 (plasmids pCB2 and pCB3). Restriction mapping, partial nucleotide sequencing, and studies on functional expression in vivo and on protein synthesis in minicells have shown that the fragment contains the regulatory region of the operon, the hisG, hisD genes, and part of the hisC gene. Another plasmid (pCB5) contained the hisG gene and part of the hisD gene. Expression of the hisG gene in the latter plasmid was under control of the tetracycline promoter of the pBR313 plasmid. The in vivo expression of the two groups of plasmids described above, as well as their effect on the expression of the histidine genes not carried by the plasmids but present on the host chromosome, has been studied. The presence of multiple copies of pCB2 or pCB3, but not of pCB5, prevented derepression of the chromosomal histidine operon. Possible interpretations of this phenomenon are discussed.'

Membranes prepared from a strain carrying a ColE1 uhp hybrid plasmid showed significantly enhanced glucose 6-phosphate binding.

Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis revealed a preferential methylation of the 50S ribosomal proteins. Proteins L11 and L16, and possibly L9, L10, L18, and L20, were methylated. On the other hand, only two possibly methylated proteins were found on the 30S subunit. A comparison of these results with those for Escherichia coli suggests a common methylation pattern for the bacterial ribosomal proteins.'

aS'The pH-conditional morphology mutant of Klebsiella pneumoniae strain MirM7 grows as cocci at pH 7 and as rods at pH 5.8. The mutant has a high-level mecillinam resistance (50% lethal dose greater than 200 micrograms/ml) in both forms. When broth cultures of the rod-shaped mutant were grown with 0.7 microgram of mecillinam per ml, cells assumed a round shape and continued to divided at a higher rate than the untreated control. A MirM7 rod-shaped revertant (MirA12), when treated with the same antibiotic concentration, changed to coccal shape and stopped dividing. The penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) of strains MirA12 and MirM7 were analyzed. K. pneumoniae had six major PBPs quite similar to those of Escherichia coli. No differences were seen in the PBPs of MirM7 cocci and rods and MirA12 cells. In particular, PBP2 was found to be present and similar in MirM7 rods and cocci and MirA12 cells. We suggest that that in gram-negative rods, a control mechanism exists which prevents further septation in the absence of lateral cell wall elongation. The unique behavior of MirM7 is due to the fact that the control mechanism is not active in this strain. This model allows us to explain the preservation of shape in bacterial rods under various conditions of growth and the mechanism of bacterial killing by mecillinam.'

aS'Autolysis of unwashed exponential-phase Escherichia coli cells was efficiently promoted by first submitting them to a quick downshock with distilled water before an upshock with 0.5 M sodium acetate, pH 6.5. The association of these two osmotic shocks had a remarkable synergistic effect and led to significant decreases in turbidity and viability. Different factors influencing the rate of cell lysis were examined. A close correlation was established between autolysis and the degradation of peptidoglycan. Both phenomena were induced by the same shock treatment, followed similar kinetics, and were efficiently blocked by addition of divalent cations. Cell lysis was also inducible by a shock treatment with 10(-3) M ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid or ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N-tetraacetic acid and blocked by the addition of divalent cations.'

aS"A phosphatase specific for the hydrolysis of 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate (KDO)-8-phosphate was purified approximately 400-fold from crude extracts of Escherichia coli B. The hydrolysis of KDO-8-phosphate to KDO and inorganic phosphate in crude extracts of E. coli B, grown in phosphate-containing minimal medium, could be accounted for by the enzymatic activity of this specific phosphatase. No other sugar phosphate tested was an alternate substrate or inhibitor of the purified enzyme. KDO-8-phosphate phosphatase was stimulated three- to fourfold by the addition of 1.0 mM Co(+) or Mg(2+) and to a lesser extent by 1.0 mM Ba(2+), Zn(2+), and Mn(2+). The activity was inhibited by the addition of 1.0 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, Cu(2+), Ca(2+), Cd(2+), Hg(2+), and chloride ions (50% at 0.1 M). The pH optimum was determined to be 5.5 to 6.5 in both tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane-acetate and HEPES (N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid) buffer. This specific phosphatase had an isoelectric point of 4.7 to 4.8 and a molecular weight of 80,000 +/- 6,000 as determined by molecular sieving and Ferguson analysis. The enzyme appeared to be composed of two identical subunits of 40,000 to 43,000 molecular weight. The apparent K(m) for KDO-8-phosphate was determined to be 5.8 +/- 0.9 x 10(-5) M in the presence of 1.0 mM Co(2+), 9.1 +/- 1 x 10(-5) M in the presence of 1.0 mM Mg(2+), and 1.0 +/- 0.2 x 10(-4) M in the absence of added Co(2+) or Mg(2+)."

aS'We have developed two procedures which allow the very rapid purification of glutamine synthetase (GS) from a diverse variety of bacteria. The first procedure, based upon differential sedimentation, depends upon the association of GS with deoxyribonucleic acid in cell extracts. The second procedure, derived from the method of C. Gross et al (J. Bacteriol. 128:382-389, 1976) for purifying ribonucleic acid polymerase by polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation, enabled us to obtain high yields of GS from either small or large quantities of cells. We used the PEG procedure to purify GS from Klebsiella aerogenes, K. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Rhizobium sp. strain 32H1, R. meliloti, Azotobacter vinelandii, Pseudomonas putida, Caulobacter crescentus, and Rhodopseudomonas capsulata. The purity of the GS obtained, judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, was high, and in many instances only a single protein band was detected.'

aS'The early biochemical consequences of inositol starvation in an inositol auxotroph of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were examined as a means of determining the cellular role of inositol. Upon withdrawal of inositol, the rate of incorporation of 32P-labeled inorganic phosphate into phosphatidylinositol and into the phosphoinositol-containing sphingolipids immediately dropped by 80 and 50%, respectively; however, synthesis of the other major phospholipids continued for 2 to 3 h at control rates. The incorporation of [U-14C]glucose into cell wall glycans began to decline immediately poststarvation and decreased to 50% of the initial rate by 80 min for mannan and by 140 min for alkali- and acid-insoluble glucan. These changes in the rates of synthesis of cell wall glycan and phosphatidylinositol were the earliest effects of inositol starvation, preceding inhibition of the synthesis of protein and ribonucleic acid as measured by incorporation of radioactive precursors into trichloroacetic acid-insoluble cell material. These results suggest that phosphatidylinositol may play a direct role in the synthesis or secretion of yeast glycans.'

aS'In the presence of polyethylene glycol (concentration optimum 20%), protoplasts of appropriate Streptomyces strains could be transfected by deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of five temperate phages (phi C31, VP5, R4, phi 448, and S14) belonging to four different immunity groups. Quantitation of transfection was made possible by plating the transfection mixture with excess uninfected protoplasts in soft agar overlays on protoplast regeneration medium so that plaques were easily detected. Optimum frequencies of transfection in the ranges of 10(-6)/DNA molecule and 10(-5)/viable protoplast were invariably obtained. It appeared that single DNA molecules initiated transfection events, and that the conformation of the DNA (i.e., circular or linear) was not important. Inhibition of transfection by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid suggested that divalent cations were also observed. A minor subpopulation of protoplasts appeared to be particularly sensitive to transfection (i.e., "competent") in some DNA-host combinations. In such cases the size of this subpopulation was the major limiting factor in obtaining high transfection frequencies. The same protoplast'

aS'A segment of Bacillus subtilis deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) previously cloned in Escherichia coli contains a gene (the 0.4-kilobase [kb] gene) whose transcription is activated at an early stage of spore development. To map the genetic location of the 0.4-kb gene, we constructed a hybrid plasmid that inserts a chloramphenicol resistance determinant into the B. subtilis chromosome by recombination at a site of homology between cloned B. subtilis DNA and the chromosome. This hybrid plasmid (p1949-2) was constructed from the E. coli plasmid pMB9, the B. sultilis chloramphenicol resistance plasmid pCM194 (whose replication function was inactivated), and B. subtilis DNA from the vicinity of the 0.4-kb gene. Transformation of B. subtilis cells to drug resistance by p1949-2 was dependent upon the B. subtilis RecE+ phenotype and resulted in specific and predictable changes in the pattern of endonuclease restriction sites in the 0.4-kb gene region of the chromosome. Chloramphenicol resistance in cells transformed by p1949-2 was mapped to the purA-cysA region of the B. subtilis chromosome, a region. In addition, DNA adjacent to the 0.4-kb gene was shown to contain the wild-type allele of genetic marker (tms-26) from that region.'

We present evidence suggesting that the effect of NH4+ on the expression of genes involved in nitrogen metabolism involves the products of the glnF and glnG genes.'

aS'The methyl carbon of ribothymidine in Loop IV of the tRNA of Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, and some other microorganisms is derived directly from 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate, not S-adenosylmethionine. The pure enzyme from S. faecalis also requires FADH2. We have obtained evidence that tetrahydrofolate is a product of the reaction and demonstrated that label from [5-3H]5-deazaFMNH2 is incorporated into the methyl moiety of ribothymidine. These data indicate that the enzyme uses methylenetetrahydrofolate solely as a 1-carbon donor and employs FADH2 as a reducing agent in vitro according to the following reaction: tRNA(U psi C) + CH2 = THF + FADH2 leads to tRNA(T psi C) + THF + FAD.'

The glutamate uptake did not occur to a significant extent in these vesicles when glutathione was added externally. The uptake of glutamate in the reconstituted system was sensitive to the temperature of incubation and to the inhibitors (serine-borate, azaserine, and 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine) of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity. The accumulated product during the transport of glutamate in the gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase reconstituted system containing intravesicular glutathione was identified as gamma-glutamyl-glutamate. These results indicate that gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase mediates the translocation of glutamate in vitro and provides evidence in support of its role in the transport of amino acids in natural membranes.'

aS'Natural abundance 13C NMR spectroscopy (at 67.9 MHz) is used to study an aqueous solution of the antifreeze glycoproteins 3 to 6 from the Antarctic cod. Assignments of resonances to specific carbons of the known Ala-Ala-[beta Gal-(1 leads to 3)-alpha-N-acetylgalactosamine]Thr repeating unit are presented. Some of the carbons of the proline residues of glycoprotein 6 are also identified. Spin-lattice relaxation times (at 30 degrees C), linewidths (at 35 degrees C), nuclear Overhauser enhancements (at 35 degrees C), and the temperature dependence of chemical shifts (from 0 degrees to 75 degrees C) all strongly suggest that these antifreeze glycoproteins are predominantly or entirely flexible random coil polymers.'

aS'AF8 cells are temperature-sensitive mutants of the cell cycle derived from baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells which arrest in the G1 phase when incubated at the nonpermissive temperature. RNA accumulation was studied in these cells by flow cytofluorimetry following serum stimulation or adenovirus 2 infection. Serum stimulation caused an increase in the amount of RNA per cell, which reached a maximum in S and G2 cells, as repeatedly reported in the literature. However, adenovirus 2 infection caused a fraction of cells to enter S phase without any concomitant increase in the amount of RNA per cell.'

aS'The hormonal metabolite of vitamin D3, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3), exerts its biological effects by initially binding to a cytosolic receptor protein. Such a protein has been demonstrated in the target organs of vitamin D3 including bone. Although the role of 1,25(OH)2D3 on the skeleton has been extensively studied in normal bone, nothing is known about its effects, if any, in abnormal bone growth. Rat osteogenic sarcoma is a useful model for bone malignancy. Tumor cells retain differentiated functions including the ability to form bone and to respond to parathyroid hormone, prostaglandins, and to a smaller extent to calcitonin with increases in cyclic AMP levels. We have here evaluated osteogenic sarcoma cell lines for the presence of a receptor for 1,25(OH)2D3. We have utilized sucrose gradient sedimentation, saturation analysis, and DNA-cellulose chromatography. Cytosol preparations from these cell lines contain a 3.3 S saturable macromolecule which binds 1,25(OH)2D3 with specificity and high affinity (Kd = 2 x 10(-10) M). The sterol-macromolecule complex binds to DNA-cellulose and its elution profile from this affinity resin is similar to that of the 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor from normal rat bone. These tumor cells should serve as a useful model for studying the action of 1,25(OH)2D3 in bone and the role of this metabolite in the biology of bone malignancy.'

aS'The functional domains of the regulatory subunit of isozyme II of cAMP-dependent protein kinase were studied. It was shown using Edman degradation that the regulatory subunit contained a phosphorylated residue which was very close in primary sequence to the site most sensitive to hydrolysis by low trypsin concentrations as postulated previously (Corbin, J.D., Sugden, P.H., West, L., Flockhart, D.A., Lincoln, T.M., and McCarthy, D. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 3997-4003). Catalytic subunit incorporated 0.9 mol of 32P from [gamma-32P]ATP into a preparation of regulatory subunit that contained 1.1 mol of endogenous phosphate. After phosphorylation by the catalytic subunit, the regulatory subunit contained 2.2 mol of chemical phosphate. The effects of heat denaturation upon the rate and extent of phosphorylation of the regulatory subunit were compared with the effects of these treatments upon the cAMP binding and inhibitory domains. These data suggested that the regulatory subunit required factors in addition to an intact phosphorylatable primary sequence in order for inhibitory activity to be expressed. Such factors might be part of the secondary or tertiary structure of the protein. These studies are discussed with respect to the mechanism of inhibition of catalytic activity, and a model of the regulatory subunit structure is proposed.'

aS'Four fluorescent compounds present in solvent extracts of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens could serve as electron donors for the biohydrogenation of cis-9,trans-11-octadecadienoate in the presence of dithionite, which was itself inactive. One of the compounds was identified as alpha-tocopherolquinol and another as alpha-tocopherolquinone. A partially purified soluble enzyme preparation from B. fibrisolvens catalyzed the reduction of alpha-tocopherolquinone to alpha-tocopherolquinol in the presence of NADH with a stoichiometry of 1:1. The ratio of alpha-tocopherolquinone produced to fatty acid reduced was 2:1 when the tocopherol derivatives were extracted aerobically. When the extraction was carried out anaerobically, the ratio was 1. It is suggested that the oxidation of 2 molecules of alpha-tocopherolquinol, each to the semiquinone, provides the electrons required for the reduction of the cis-bond of the conjugated dienoic fatty acid. Although alpha-tocopherol, phylloquinol, and reduced menadione are inactive, ubiquinol-4, ubiquinol-10, and trimethylhydroquinone show about one-half the activity of alpha-tocopherolquinol. Plastoquinol and trimethylphytylbenzoquinol are as active as alpha-tocopherolquinol.'

aS'The mechanism of Na+-dependent D-glucose transport was investigated by kinetic means in rabbit small intestinal and renal brush border membranes. The rate of glucose transport was measured under equilibrium exchange conditions as a function of its own concentration and of the Na+ concentration. Likewise, the rate of Na+ transport was measured as a function of the D-glucose concentration. Noteworthy characteristics of the Na+-dependent glucose transport system are: 1) linear dependence of the glucose transport rate on Na+ concentration up to 0.1 M (at constant ionic strength), indicating a 1:1 stoichiometry of Na+-D-glucose cotransport under net flux conditions; 2) virtual Na+ independence of the apparent affinity of the transport system for D-glucose; 3) a stimulation-inhibition pattern if the transport rate of either substrate (D-glucose, Na+) is measured as function of increasing concentrations of its co-substrate; 4) a varying flux ratio of D-glucose to Na+ which can be either above or below 1, depending on the concentration ratio of the two substrates; 5) a rate constant for translocation of the loaded carrier which is faster than that for the dissociation of Na+. Treating Na+-D glucose co-transport analogous to an enzyme reaction, these features are consistent with an iso-ordered-bi-bi kinetic model, whereby the first solute that binds to the transport system at one membrane interface is the one that is released first at the other interface (first-in-first-out characteristics). The kinetic model is explained by a gated pore mechanism, whereby the translocation of the transported solutes across the permeability barrier is achieved by a rocker-type conformational change of the transport system (presumed to be a protein) which moves the permeability barrier past the solutes.'

aS'Incubation of rat red cells with liposomes containing radioactive glucosylceramide, together with unlabeled phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol, produced cells labeled with the glycolipid. Part of the bound cerebroside could be removed by further incubation with unlabeled liposomes. Both processes, uptake and release, were stimulated by adding a preparation obtained from bovine spleen. The active material was purified partially by ammonium sulfate precipitation and gel permeation with a Sephadex G-75 column. The latter step indicated a molecular weight of about 22,000. The material lost much of its activity when treated with trypsin or N-ethylmaleimide, indicating that it is a protein. The "cerebroside uptake protein" was quite stable if stored in dithioerythritol at 4 degrees C. Tests with liposomes containing labeled phosphatidylcholine or cholesterol showed that the red cells took up these lipids as well, but the transfer protein exerted little effect on this. Ghosts prepared from rat red cells also took up the three lipids from the liposomes and here, as well, the uptake protein showed high specificity in facilitating the uptake of cerebroside. This appears to be the first demonstration of the existence of a glycolipid transfer protein. Possible physiological roles for the uptake protein in red cell metabolism and in the modulation of the glycosphingolipid composition of cell membranes are discussed.'

aS'Methylation of cytochrome c was studied in vivo using double label with L-[methyl-3H]methionine and DL-[2-14C]methionine. In pulse-chase experiments the cytochrome c associated with the mitochondrial fraction possessed a higher ratio of 3H/14C label, suggesting the presence of methylated cytochrome c. The appearance of methylated cytochrome c in mitochondria showed no lag phase. The inhibition of cytochrome c methylation in presence of cycloheximide indicated that both the methylation and protein synthesis were tightly coupled and cycloheximide selectively inhibited cytochrome c methylation. There was also an indication of selective turnover of incorporation methyl groups in preformed cytochrome c.'

aS'Incubation of 2-[14C]pyrrolidone with sliced rat liver and analysis of the incubation medium by silica gel chromatography revealed that 2-[14C]pyrrolidone is metabolized to an unknown. It was previously shown by Lundgren and Hankins ((Lundgren, D.W, and Hankins, J. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 7130-7133) that slices of rat liver readily synthesized 2-pyrrolidone from putrescine. The unknown metabolite was partially purified by methanol/chloroform extraction, activated charcoal column chromatography, and two-dimensional thin layer chromatography on silica gel plates. The 2-pyrrolidone metabolite was derivatized with bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluroacetamide and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The mass of the molecular ion (245) and fragment ions suggests that the 2-pyrrolidone metabolite is 5-hydroxy-2-pyrrolidone. The mass spectrum of synthetic 5-hydroxy-2-pyrrolidone was identical to that of the unknown metabolite. Synthetic 5-hydroxy-2-[3H]pyrrolidone co-chromatographed on silica gel sheets with the unknown 2-[14C]pyrrolidone metabolite obtained directly from incubation media. Under appropriate conditions (pH 7.5, no acid treatment of medium), putrescine is metabolized to 5-hydroxy-2-pyrrolidone via 2-pyrrolidone. Several effector compounds, but not necessarily the same ones, inhibit or enhance, or both, the conversion of putrescine to 2-pyrrolidone and of 2-pyrrolidone to 5-hydroxy-2-pyrrolidone. This is the first demonstration of the biosynthesis of 5-hydroxy-2-pyrrolidone.'

aS'The extent of productive RNA chain initiation in vitro by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase holoenzyme from the bacteriophage T7 A1 and A2 promoters on purified T7 DNA templates has been investigated at very low concentrations of the ribonucleoside triphosphate substrates. As the concentration of ribonucleoside triphosphates in the reaction is decreased from 10 to 1 micro M, the extent of productive RNA chain initiation at these promoter sites drops precipitously at about 3 micro M. At 1 micro M substrate concentration, productive chain initiation from the A1 promoter does not occur even after extended incubation although the dinucleoside tetraphosphate pppApU is produced at a significant rate under these conditions. The reason for the inability of RNA polymerase to carry out productive RNA chain initiation at 1 micro M substrate concentration is not yet understood. The phenomenon is not due to substrate consumption, enzyme inactivation, or a requirement for a nucleoside triphosphatase activity in the reaction. The possibility is raised that there are additional nucleoside triphosphate binding sites on E. coli RNA polymerase which play some role in the process of productive RNA chain initiation.'

aS'Four spin-labeled analogs of adenosylcobalamin have been synthesized to aid in the detection and identification of radical intermediates in the adenosylcobalamin-dependent enzymatic reactions and to serve as probes of the coenzyme, substrate, and effector binding sites of the protein. Three isomers of adenosylcobalamin, in which one of the propionamide side chains (b, d, or e) was hydrolyzed, and adenosylepicobalamin e-carboxylic acid were reacted with 4-amino-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl in the presence of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide to yield the spin-labeled adenosylcorrinoids. These spin-labeled derivatives of adenosylcobalamin function as coenzymes and/or inhibitors of dioldehydrase from Klebsiella pneumoniae and of ribonucleotide reductase from Corynebacterium nephridii. Electron spin resonance has been used to monitor the photolytic cleavage of the carbon-cobalt bond of these analogs.'

By combining our cross-linking procedure with two-dimensional electrophoretic techniques, we show further that it is possible to trace the nucleosomal origins of a spectrum of cross-linked chromatin products.'

aS'Four kinds of rabbit thymus H1 histone differ among themselves in their ability to retain DNA on nitrocellulose filters. This is true for linear, or superhelical DNA, but the order of effectiveness of the different H1 histones depends on the physical conformation of the DNA. For linear DNA the binding efficiencies of the H1 histones are: RTL2 = RTL3 greater than RTL4 greater than RTL1. This order of effectiveness parallels the effectiveness of the H1 histones previously found for the condensation of linear DNA as observed by circular dichroism and viscosity. The binding efficiencies of the various histones toward superhelical DNA were: RTL4 greater than RTL3 greater than RTL1 greater than RTL2. The variation in amino acid sequence between different rabbit thymus H1 histones might thus introduce structural variations in nucleohistone fibers and perhaps in chromatin.'

aS'Slices from various organs and tissues of 14-day-old chick embryos synthesize a novel class of glycoproteins containing sulfated oligosaccharide chains that are not released from the polypeptides under conditions that cleave O-glycosidically linked chains. Of the tissues examined, embryonic lung and liver were the most active in incorporating [35S]O4 into these oligosaccharide chains, which were analyzed as glycopeptides following Pronase digestion. These low molecular weight sulfated glycopeptides were resistant to several chemical and enzymatic treatments that degrade a variety of high molecular weight sulfated glycosaminoglycans. The incorporation of both [3H]glucosamine and [35S]O4 into the glycopeptides was inhibited by tunicamycin, an antibiotic which inhibits the N-glycosylation of proteins. These observations, coupled with the finding that these chains were resistant to beta elimination, suggest that this novel type of sulfated oligosaccharide is N-glycosidically linked to protein. The sulfated glycopeptides from chick embryonic lung were characterized as containing terminal fucose and sialic acid residues as well as O-sulfated N-acetylglucosamine residues. Comparable studies with slices of adult liver and lung indicated that they were far less active in the synthesis of this class of sulfated glycopeptides, even though these organs, like those from the embryo, actively synthesize sulfated glycosaminoglycans.'

aS"An exoribonuclease from calf thymus which specifically cleaves poly(A) in the single- or in the double-stranded form has been isolated and purified to homogeneity. The enzyme has a molecular weight of about 80,000 as estimated by gel filtration, and consists of two subunits with molecular weights of 58,000 and 31,000 as analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. For optimal activity, the poly(A)-specific exoribonuclease requires divalent cations, alkaline pH, and 39 degrees C. The enzyme is inhibited at 0.2 ionic strength and is sensitive to reagents for thiol groups. The only product formed by the action of the enzyme is 5'-AMP. It is suggested that this enzyme plays a role in the degradation of the poly(A) sequence of mRNA in the nucleus."

aS'Heptaprenyl pyrophosphate synthetase was detected in partially purified extracts of Bacillus subtilis. The enzyme catalyzed the synthesis of all-trans C35 prenyl pyrophosphate from isopentenyl pyrophosphate and farnesyl or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, but it did not catalyze a reaction between isopentenyl pyrophosphate and either dimethylallyl or geranyl pyrophosphate. The enzyme reaction proceeded with an elimination of 2-pro-R hydrogen of isopentenyl pyrophosphate without accumulation of any prenyl pyrophosphate shorter than C35. The molecular weight of the enzyme was estimated by gel filtration to be 45,000. Michaelis constants for isopentenyl, farnesyl, and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate were 12.8, 13.3, and 8.3 microM, respectively.'

aS'The binding of labeled hyaluronate to the surface of Simian virus 40-transformed 3T3 cells was studied as a function of 1) pH, 2) ionic strength, 3) temperature, and 4) molecular weight of the hyaluronate. Binding occurred over a wide range of pH values with optima at pH 7 and at less than pH 4. Binding at low pH was eliminated at high ionic strength whereas that at physiological pH was enhanced, with a maximum at 0.5 M NaCl. The enhancement of binding at pH 7 was reversible and independent of the particular salt used. Scatchard plot analysis showed that increasing the ionic strength resulted in both a decrease in the dissociation constant (Kd) and an increase in the amount bound at saturation (Bmax). Temperature also influenced the binding of hyaluronate to the cell surface. The amount bound at low temperatures (0 degrees C) was 3 to 5 times that bound at high temperatures (40 degrees C) with a sharp transition occurring at 18 degrees C, the temperature of phase transition of the plasma membrane. The temperature effect was primarily a change in the Bmax and was reversible. Finally the molecular weight of the ligand influenced the binding. High molecular weight preparations of hyaluronate had a higher binding affinity (lower Kd) and a lower Bmax than did smaller molecular weight preparations.'

aS'Using a protein synthesizing in vitro system programmed with MS2-RNA, the ability of alanine tRNAs with the anticodons U*GC (U* represents 5-oxyacetic acid uridine monophosphate) and IGC to read the alanine codons in the coat protein cistron of MS2 has been determined both under conditions of no competition, where the alanyl-tRNA used was the only aminoacylated tRNAAla present in the system, and in experiments where the two alanyl-tRNAs were competing against each other. Under conditions of no competition, each of the anticodons can read all four alanine codons. However, when the anticodons compete for the codon GCC, the anticodon IGC, which can read all three positions of the codon according to the rules of Watson-Crick base pairing, is considerably more efficient than U*GC, which misreads the codon by reading only the first two positions and presumably disregards the third nucleotide of the codon. The outcome of the competition experiments also reveals two apparent violations of the wobble restrictions: the anticodon U*GC reads the codon GUU almost as effectively as does the anticodon IGC, and IGC is almost as effective as U*GC in reading the codon GCG.'

aS'2Two types of protein kinase inhibitors present in rat liver nuclei have been partially purified and characterized. They are specific for the nuclear enzymes, being inert toward the protein kinases in the cytosol. One inhibitor is a 150,000 dalton, heat-labile, acidic protein; the other is a family of two oligonucleotides. Inhibitory activity in crude extracts becomes measurable only after complete removal of protein kinase activity by affinity chromatography (Farron-Furstenthal, F., and Lightholder, J.R. (1977) FEBS Lett. 84, 313). Initial separation of the inhibitor protein from the oligonucleotide inhibitors was achieved by filtration through an Amicon pressure cell. Further purification of the inhibitor protein was obtained by chromatography on ion exchangers and Bio-Gel. The oligonucleotides were purified by DEAE-cellulose chromatography and paper electrophoresis. The effects of the two types of inhibitors are additive. The 170 to 200% recovery of protein kinase activity after removal of the inhibitors from the initial extracts suggests that the inhibitors contribute in a quantitatively significant measure to the regulation of nuclear protein phosphorylation.'

aS'Human bronchial glycoproteins from a patient suffering from chronic bronchitis were subjected to alkaline borohydride degradation and a heterogeneous mixture of reduced oligosaccharides and glycopeptides was obtained. The shortest neutral oligosaccharides were subsequently fractionated by DAX4 anion exchange chromatography into 12 fractions. Five major oligosaccharides were purified by preparative paper chromatography. Their structures were determined by using periodic oxidation, methylation analysis, gas liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and enzymatic degradation. Two oligosaccharides and three trisaccharides were characterized as galactose (Gal) beta 1 leads to 3 N-acetylgalactosaminitol (GalNActitol), N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) beta 1 leads to 3 GalNActitol, Gal 1 leads to 4 GlcNAc 1 leads to 3 GalNActitol, GlcNAc 1 leads to 3 Gal 1 leads to 3 GalNActitol and fucose alpha 1 leads to 2 Gal beta 1 leads to 3 GalNActitol.'

aS'Enzymatic reduction of the hemoglobin (Hb) M group was studied. Hb M Milwaukee-1 and Hb M Saskatoon were reduced by NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase highly purified from human erythrocytes. Hb M Saskatoon was also reduced by another enzyme in red cells, NADPH-flavin reductase. The reduction rates of Hb M Saskatoon by both enzymes were almost the same as those of MetHb A. The reduction of Hb M Milwaukee-1 by NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase progressed much more slowly than that of Hb M Saskatoon and MetHb A. It took 1/2 h and 10 h for the 50% reduction of Hb M Saskatoon and Hb M Milwaukee-1, respectively. These two methemoglobin reductases from erythrocytes did not reduce other hemoglobins M such as Hb M Iwate, Hb M Boston, or Hb M Hyde Park. A possible role of these abnormal hemoglobins as oxygen carriers and the reason for cyanosis in the patients of Hb M Saskatoon and Hb M Milwaukee-1 are discussed.'

aS'A specific binding of p-nitrophenyl alpha-D-galactopyranoside has been measured by flow dialysis with Escherichia coli ML 308225 membrane vesicles containing the lac carrier protein. The number of binding sites, 0.45 nmol/mg of membrane protein, remains unchanged in the presence or absence of energy. On the other hand, "energization" increases the M protein affinity for p-nitrophenyl alpha-D-galactopyranoside. The dissociation constant (Kd) is 4 and 21 microM in the presence and absence, respectively, of D-lactate. The same energization effects are found with E. coli A3245 membrane vesicles. p-Nitrophenyl alpha-D-galactopyranoside can be used as a substrate to study energization effect on binding to the lactose permease M protein. These results corroborate observations that energy increases the lac carrier protein affinity for its substrate, and they also confirm the concentration of the M protein, which corresponds to 1.4% of the membrane protein.'

aS'The amino acid sequence of the sulfate-binding protein from Salmonella typhimurium LT2 was determined by automated sequenator analysis of whole protein and fragments derived by chemical and enzymatic cleavage of whole protein. The fragments were products of limited trypsin digestion at arginine, cleavage at tryptophan by BrNps-skatole and o-iodosobenzoic acid, digestion with the protease from Staphylococcus aureus V8 at Glu-X bonds, cleavage by hydroxylamine at Asn-Gly bonds, and subdigestion with trypsin, chymotrypsin, and the Staphylococcus protease. The COOH-terminal sequence was confirmed using carboxypeptidase B and amino acid analysis. The sulfate-binding protein was determined to contain a single polypeptide of 310 residues with a molecular weight of 34,667 calculated from the sequence.'

aS'Previous studies showed that the gene for RNA polymerase subunit alpha at 72 min on the Escherichia coli chromosome is co-transcribed with genes for ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) S11, S4, and L17, and probably S13. DNA sequence analysis of a deletion mutant has now established that the S13 gene is a part of the alpha operon and the gene order is promoter (P alpha), rpsM (S13), rpsK (S11), rpsD(S4), rpoA(alpha), and rplQ(L17). The DNA sequence extending 650 bases before S13 gene was determined. In vitro transcription experiments establish the probable location of the alpha promoter (P alpha) within this sequence. The start site is 94 nucleotides upstream from the initiation codon (GUG) of the S13 gene. This promoter has features previously noted as common to E. coli promoters. However, comparison with four other sequenced promoters of r-protein operons shows no unique common features that might account for the common regulation of synthesis of r-proteins. This lack of sequence similarity in promoters of r-protein operons may be because r-protein synthesis is regulated at least partially at a post-transcriptional level.'

aS"The str operon at 72 min on the Escherichia coli chromosome contains genes for ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) S12 (str or rpsL) and S7 (rpsG) and elongation factors G (fus) and Tu (tufA). The sequence of the entire S12 gene, the S12-S7 intercistronic region, and the beginning of the S7 gene is reported. Also, the sequence of the end of the S7 gene, the S7-G intercistronic region, and the beginning of the elongation fractor G gene is reported. The S12-S7 intercistronic region is 96 base pairs long, in contrast to other intercistronic regions in r-protein operons which have been found to vary from 3 to 66 base pairs. The S7-G intercistronic region is only 27 bases long, supporting the previous conclusion that r-protein and elongation factor genes are co-transcribed. A comparison of translation initiation sites of the S12 and S7 genes, and other examples of co-transcribed r-protein genes, reveals no obvious features that could account for equimolar synthesis of all r-proteins. The codon usage in the S12 and S7 genes follows the pattern observed in other r-protein genes; that is, there is a highly preferential usage of codons recognized by the most abundant of isoaccepting tRNA species. This pattern could reflect the cell's need for efficient translation or minimal errors, or both, in r-protein synthesis."

aS'Major forms of hexokinases (Hex A and Hex C) in Drosophila melanogaster were purified to homogeneity by utilizing affinity chromatography and preparative isoelectric focusing column as the key steps. Three different affinity ligands immobilized on Sepharose (3-amino pyridine adenine dinucleotide, glucosamine, and 8-(6-aminohexyl)-amino-ATP) were employed during different stages of enzyme purification. Antisera against purified Hex A and Hex C were raised in rabbits. Hex A, the major form in adults, and Hex B, the predominant form in larvae, showed complete immunological identity by double immunodiffusion and enzyme immunoinactivation studies. No cross-reactivity was observed between the antiserum to Hex A and Hex C or between the antiserum to Hex C and Hex A. By gel filtration chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulfate-acrylamide gel electrophoresis, all of the Drosophila hexokinases were shown to be monomers of molecular weights ranging from 40,000 to 50,000. Multiple forms of Drosophila hexokinase were studied extensively with respect to their biochemical properties including Michaelis constants, substrate and coenzyme specificities, pH-dependent activity, and thermal stability. Consistent with previous genetic evidence, the results of our studies also suggest that Hex A and Hex B (with subforms B1 and B2) are products of a single structural gene but are modified post-translationally, whereas the allelic forms of Hex C (C1 and C2) are derived from a different structural gene from that of Hex A and Hex B.'

aS'The uptake of nucleosides and the synthesis of RNA in Tetrahymena thermophila were examined following amino acid starvation. Omission of leucine, phenylalanine, or arginine from the medium resulted in a rapid decrease in the incorporation of [3H]uridine into the acid-soluble pool and acid-insoluble material (RNA). Amino acid starvation inhibited the uptake of all ribo- and deoxyribonucleosides tested but did not affect the uptake of amino acids or glucose. In addition, under the conditions used, the omission of an amino acid did not result in a large decrease in amino acid incorporation into total protein. Treatment of cells with cycloheximide or emetine gave results similar to the effects of amino acid starvation, but in these experiments the inhibition of protein synthesis was essentially complete. Nucleotide pool sizes were also measured following amino acid starvation. ATP and UTP levels were essentially unchanged, but the dTTP pool size was decreased by 40%. The decrease in RNA synthesis in vivo in the absence of an essential amino acid was reflected in the endogenous RNA synthetic activity of isolated nuclei. However, when solubilized RNA polymerase activity was measured with calf thymus DNA as template, no significant difference was observed between control and amino acid-starved cells.'

aS'Cycloheximide, frequently used as an inhibitor of protein synthesis in vivo and in vitro, has been found to cause a significant reduction of the synthesis of digitonin-precipitable sterols from acetate, but not from mevalonate, at a concentration of 1 mM in the 10,000 x g supernatant fraction of rat liver homogenate preparations. The results of studies of the metabolism of labeled leucine under the same conditions indicated that the effect of cycloheximide on sterol synthesis from acetate was not related to an effect of cycloheximide on protein synthesis. Preincubation of the 10,000 x g supernatant fraction of rat liver homogenates with cycloheximide (1 mM) caused a significant reduction in the levels of acetate thiokinase and hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase activities but not of acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase activity. Preincubation of the 100,000 x g supernatant fraction of rat liver homogenates with cycloheximide (1 mM or 0.3 mM) also caused a significant reduction of the levels of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase activity. When cycloheximide (1 mM) was preincubated with the 100,000 x g supernatant fraction, a reduction in the level of acetate thiokinase activity was observed. Preincubation of rat liver microsomes with cycloheximide (1 mM and 3 mM) had no effect on the level of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase activity. These results suggest that biological effects observed upon exposure of cells or tissues to high concentrations of cycloheximide may not be exclusively due to effects of the cycloheximide on the synthesis of protein.'

aS'Escherichia coli heat-stable enterotoxin derived from a strain pathogenic for man has been purified 13,000-fold to apparent homogeneity. The purification scheme involved growth in a minimal medium. Amberlite XAD-2 chromatography, acetone fractionation, Sephadex G-25 filtration, DEAE-Sephacel ion exchange chromatography, and Sephadex G-25 gel filtration. This scheme resulted in a white flocculent material which was biologically active in 2.7-ng quantities. Heat-stable enterotoxin was homogeneous as determined by the following: (a) a single peak on gel filtration; (b) a single band on thin layer chromatography; (c) a single band on thin layer electrophoresis; (d) a single NH2-terminal amino acid residue, asparagine; and (e) an amino acid composition demonstrating a stoichiometric relationship among the amino acids. The molecule is composed of 10 different amino acids, a total of 18 amino acid residues, one-third of which are half-cystine. The molecule contains no detectable carbohydrate. Biological activity is promptly lost on treatment with the reducing reagents, 2-mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol, or after performic acid oxidation, suggesting the presence of disulfide bridges which are required for biological activity.'

The most purified preparation had a specific activity of 6,920 units/mg of protein, the highest value so far reported, and was homogeneous in the polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme was monomeric and its molecular weight was approximately 71,600. The purified enzyme was analyzed for the amino acid composition and shown to have an abundance of aromatic amino acid residues amounting to 12% of the total residues. Spectral examination did not reveal the presence of heme and flavin. No metals were detected by atomic absorption spectroscopy either. Sulfhydryl reagents, metals, and metal chelators did not affect the enzyme activity to any significant extent. On the contrary, the purified enzyme was activated by crude phospholipid extracts from liver mitochondria and commercially available phospholipids about 2- to 5-fold. An increase in Vmax by the phospholipid extract as well as phosphatidylethanolamine accompanied a decrease in Km for coproporphyrinogen III from 48 microM to 18 to 25 microM. Synthetic nonionic detergents also exhibited an activation effect, although ionic detergents diminished the activity.'

aS'Purified coproporphyrinogen oxidase catalyzed conversion of 2-beta-hydroxypropionic acid-4-propionic acid deuteroporphyrinogen IX, 2-propionic acid-4-beta-hydroxypropionic acid deuteroporphyrinogen IX, 2,4-bis (beta-hydroxypropionic acid) deuteroporphyrinogen IX, harderoporphyrinogen, and isoharderoporphyrinogen to protoporphyrinogen IX. This result suggests that the enzymatic conversion of propionate groups of coproporphyrinogen III to vinyl groups of protoporphyrinogen IX occurs stepwise starting from position 2 to 4 through beta-hydroxypropionate porphyrinogen as an intermediate. When coproporphyrinogen oxidase was treated with tetranitromethane, an initial modification of 1 tyrosine residue per molecule did not affect the enzyme activity, whereas modification of a second tyrosine residue resulted in a substantial inactivation of the enzyme. Conversion of 2,4-bis-(beta-hydroxypropionic acid) deuteroporphyrinogen XI into protoporphyrinogen IX was not affected by the tyrosine residue modification. Both modification and kinetic studies led to a conclusion that at least one tyrosine residue is involved in the active site of the enzyme, presumably participating in the initial reaction of the oxidation step of a propionate group to beta-hydroxypropionate.'

aS'The isolated complexes of ferricytochrome c with cytochrome c oxidase, cytochrome c reductase (cytochrome bc1 or complex III), and cytochrome c1 (a subunit of cytochrome c reductase) were investigated by the method of differential chemical modification (Bosshard, H.R. (1979) Methods Biochem. Anal. 25, 273-301). By this method the chemical reactivity of each of the 19 lysyl side chains of horse cytochrome c was compared in free and in complexed cytochrome c and binding sites were deduced from altered chemical reactivities of particular lysyl side chains in complexed cytochrome c. The most important findings follow. 1. The binding sites on cytochrome c for cytochrome c oxidase and cytochrome c reductase, defined in terms of the involvement of particular lysyl residues, are indistinguishable. The two oxidation-reduction partners of cytochrome c interact at the front (exposed heme edge) and top left part of the molecule, shielding mainly lysyl residues 8, 13, 72 + 73, 86, and 87. The chemical reactivity of lysyl residues 22, 39, 53, 55, 60, 99, and 100 is unaffected by complex formation while the remaining lysyl residues in positions 5, 7, 25, 27, 79, and 88 are somewhat less reactive in the complexed molecule. 2. When bound to cytochrome c reductase or to the isolated cytochrome c1 subunit of the reductase the same lysyl side chains of cytochrome c are shielded. This indicates that cytochrome c binds to the c1 subunit of the reductase during the electron transfer process.'

aS"The number of binding sites and the dissociation constants were determined for the binding of bilirubin to human liver ligandin and to human serum albumin. Albumin has a primary bilirubin binding site (KD = 0.03 microM), measured by the peroxidase procedure, and two apparently equivalent secondary binding sites (KD = 2 microM), determined by fluorescence quenching experiments. By contrast, ligandin does not have a corresponding high affinity site. The absence of this high affinity site was shown both by the peroxidase procedure and by direct competition between albumin and ligandin for bilirubin. Bilirubin binding to ligandin, measured by fluorescence quenching, is complex. At both pH 6.5 and 7.4, two interacting sites were observed with a Hill coefficient of 1.5, K' approximately 5 microM. Bilirubin binding to ligandin is not independent of glutathione S-transferase activity. Depending upon pH and upon the order with which the reactants are added, bilirubin can markedly alter the transferase activity. The results are interpreted in terms of kinetically stable conformational isomers of ligandin induced by bilirubin or by glutathione."

aS'3T3-L1 preadipocytes, cloned from 3T3 mouse embryo fibroblasts, differentiate in monolayer culture into cells with morphological and biochemical characteristics of adipocytes. Deposition of cytoplasmic triglyceride is associated with an increased lipogenic rate and a coordinate rise in the activities of many lipogenic enzymes (Mackall, J.C., Student, A.K., Polakis, S.E., and Lane, M.D. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 6462-6464). During differentiation induced by a 48-h treatment of postconfluent cells with methylisobutylxanthine, dexamethasone, and insulin, fatty acid synthetase activity increased to a level 19.5-fold higher than that of undifferentiated 3T3-L1 cells or nondifferentiating 3T3-C2 cells. The rate of [3H]leucine incorporation into immunoadsorbable fatty acid synthetase rose to a maximum and then declined to a new level 12.5-fold higher in differentiated than in undifferentiated 3T3-L1 cells. The kinetics of the changing [3H]leucine incorporation rate was reflected in the kinetics of the rise in fatty acid synthetase activity. The rate of degradation of fatty acid synthetase, determined by pulse-chase experiments, was unaffected by differentiation, the t1/2 remaining constant at 1.4 days. It is concluded that the higher level of fatty acid synthetase activity in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells can be attributed entirely to an increased rate of enzyme synthesis. The rate of total cellular protein synthesis also increases early early in differentiation, lending support to a model in which the synthesis of a large number of "differentiated proteins" is coordinately induced.'

aS'N-t-Butyloxycarbonyl-gamma-L-glutaminyl-2-bromo-4-hydroxybenzene alpha-benzyl ester was synthesized as a precursor to gamma-L-glutaminyl-4-hydroxy[2-3H]benzene. With this labeled compound and the previously synthesized gamma-L-glutaminyl-4-hydroxy[3,5-3H]benzene, the stoichiometry of ring substitution was determined for the tyrosinase-catalyzed metabolic pathway of Agaricus bisporus. In this pathway, gamma-L-glutaminyl-4-hydroxybenzene is hydroxylated to gamma-L-glutaminyl-3,4-dihydroxybenzene which is oxidized to gamma-L-glutaminyl-3,4-benzoquinone and a compound of previously unknown structure, "490." The results indicated that the "490" quinone was derived from gamma-L-glutaminyl-3,4-benzoquinone without further ring substitution. A base-catalyzed, nonenzymatic reaction of gamma-L-glutaminyl-3,4-benzoquinone was observed which yielded a compound with a 490 nm chromophore. gamma-Glutamyl transpeptidase cleavage of gamma-L-glutaminyl-3,4-dihydroxybenzene led to the release of 4-aminocatechol which air-oxidized to a compound with identical spectral properties to "490." The structure of "490" was thus determined to be 2-hydroxy-4-imino-2,5-cyclohexadiene-1-one(2-hydroxy-4-iminoquinone). The tyrosinase-catalyzed hydroxylation of gamma-L-glutaminyl-4-hydroxybenzene was found to be optimal at pH 8.0, while the enzymatic oxidation of gamma-L-glutaminyl-3,4-dihydroxybenzene was optimal at pH 6.0.'

aS'We describe the interactions at 25 degrees C of the 3-carbanions (I-) and 3-carbon conjugate acids (I) of 3-nitropropionate, 3-nitro-2-hydroxypropionate, and 3-nitro-2-aminopropionate with fumarase and aspartase. (Formula: see text) 1. Ia- and Ib- inhibit fumarase competitively and are bound more than 4000- and 18,000-fold more tightly, respectively, than Ia and Ib, and 5000- and 11,000-fold more tightly, respectively, than succinate. Ic inhibits aspartase competitively and is bound (depending on the ionization state of the 2-amino group) more than 220- to 1630-fold more tightly than Ic and 290- to 2200-fold more tightly than succinate. 2. Fumarase and asparatse bind I- much more tightly than their respective substrates. Thus, Km/KIa- and Km/KIb- for fumarase are 375 and 900, respectively (with KIa- = 64 nm and KIb- = 27 nM at pH 7.0). For asparatse, Km/KIa- = 519, while Km/KIc- = 1630 (2-amino group unprotonated) or 220 (2-amino group protonated). 3. The values of kI and k-I (FORMULA: SEE TEXT) for fumarase are respectively, 0.55 X 10(8) M-1 s-1 and 3.5 s-1 for Ia- and 2.6 X 10(8) M-1 s-1 and 6.9 s-1 for Ib- at pH 7.0. These results, together with those of control experiments with Malic Enzyme, suggest that Ia-, Ib-, and Ic- are transition state, or transient intermediate, analogues and that the mechanisms of the fumarase and aspartase reactions involve enzyme-bound 3-carbanions.'

aS"Treatment of intact pigeon erythrocytes with trypsin or alpha-chymotrypsin does not alter the isoproterenol-dependent adenylate cyclase activity in plasma membranes prepared after proteolysis. However, both proteases affect adenylate cyclase activity when isolated membranes are digested. Thus, the proteases probably act at the cytoplasmic side of the membranes. This conclusion is supported by the finding that proteases are able to inhibit NADH cytochrome c oxidoreductase, an enzyme located on the inner face of the plasma membrane. In isolated membranes, trypsin inhibits adenylate cyclase. Chymotrypsin (2.5 microgram/ml, 10 min, 37 degrees C) activates adenylate cyclase about 3-fold when the enzyme activity is measured with NaF, guanosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imino)-triphosphate, or guanosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imino)-triphosphate and isoproterenol. Chymotrypsin also activates adenylate cyclase in membranes pretreated with cholera toxin. Activation by chymotrypsin is not expressed when adenylate cyclase is assayed with 5 mM Mn2+ without guanine nucleotides or fluoride. However, the chymotryptic activation is expressed when guanosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imino)-triphosphate is present together with Mn2+. We conclude that interaction of the guanine nucleotide regulatory subunit with the catalytic subunit of adenylate cyclase is required for expression of chymotryptic activation."

aS'The growth of Chinese hamster ovary cells in a complete medium lacking asparagine is inhibited by beta-aspartylhydroxamate. The inhibition is overcome by the presence of asparagine in the growth medium. beta-Aspartylhydroxamate inhibits the activity of both asparagine synthetase and asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase in vitro. beta-Aspartylhydroxamate-resistant clones of Chinese hamster ovary cells have been isolated and three of these have been characterized. One clone, AH12, is 3-fold more resistant to beta-aspartylhydroxamate than the parental line and has 2 times higher levels of asparagine synthetase activity. Strains AH2 and AH5 are 6- to 7-fold more resistant to beta-aspartylhydroxamate and have 5 times higher levels of asparagine synthetase. The regulation of the expression of asparagine synthetase is altered in all three resistant cell lines. Whereas asparagine synthetase activity varies 2- to 3-fold in response to the asparagine content of the medium or to the extent of aminoacylation of tRNALeu in the parental cells, the activity of asparagine synthetase in the resistant cells is elevated under all growth conditions. No significant changes in the Km for substrates, Ki for beta-aspartylhydroxamate, or thermal stability were found for the asparagine synthetase of the resistant cells. These variants should prove useful in understanding the mechanisms involved in regulating the levels of asparagine synthetase in mammalian cells.'

aS'Sea urchin sperm contain an acrosin-like enzyme with an apparent molecular weight of 53,000. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis reveals two subunits of 34,000 daltons and 18,000 daltons. The Mr = 34,000 subunit is the catalytic entity as revealed both by labeling with [14C]diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate and by proteolytic activity after dissociation of the subunits at pH 2.5. Both the 34,000-dalton and the 53,000-dalton forms of the enzyme catalyze the hydrolysis of N alpha-benzoyl-L-arginine ethyl ester and both are inactivated by inhibitors of low molecular weight, whereas only the Mr = 34,000 form is inactivated by large proteinaceous inhibitors. Only the Mr = 34,000 form catalyzes proteolysis of denatured lysozyme or the B chain of insulin. The Mr = 18,000 subunit appears to suppress the proteolytic activity but not the activity toward the small ester substrate. These findings are discussed in terms of possible roles of this enzyme in the control of early events leading to fertilization.'

aS'A mutation of yeast pai1 has been isolated which leads to altered regulation of proteinase A inhibitor activity. Under conditions of derepression, this mutant as compared with wild type has a 70% reduction in proteinase A inhibitor activity, but no change in the activities of proteinase A or B. The growth of strains carrying the pai1 mutation is sensitive to temperature and pH. The altered physiological and biochemical phenotypes of the mutant appear to be the consequences of a single mutation which segregates 2:2 at meiosis. Results obtained with this mutant indicate that proteinase A and its inhibitor are two independently synthesized polypeptide chains rather than two proteins resulting from proteolytic cleavage of a single precursor. Furthermore, proteinase A and its inhibitor appear to be regulated independently of each other. Studies on the mutant also indicate that the regulation of the proteinase A inhibitor is different from that of the proteinase B inhibitor. In wild type cells there is an excess of proteinase A inhibitor over proteinase A, whereas in the mutant cells there is a 2.5-fold excess of proteinase A over proteinase A inhibitor. This excess proteinase A does not lead to detectable alterations in overall protein degradation. However, tryptophan synthase and proteinase B inhibitor proteins which are sensitive to proteinase A attack in vitro show an enhanced loss of activity in the mutant.'

aS'Methotrexate and 1-ethyl-3(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide react to form a relatively unstable product (activated methotrexate) that irreversibly inhibits methotrexate transport in L1210 mouse leukemia cells. The rate of methotrexate transport was reduced 50% by pretreatment of cells with activated methotrexate at a concentration of 1 microM and by 98% upon exposure to an excess (40 microM) of this agent. Specificity was demonstrated by the fact that activated methotrexate had no effect on other transport systems (i.e. leucine and phosphate) and that complete protection against inactivation was afforded by either the unlabeled substrate (methotrexate) or a competitive inhibitor (phosphate). The carbodiimide-generated derivatives of aminopterin, folate, and p-aminobenzoylglutamate were also irreversible inhibitors of methotrexate transport, and their relative effectiveness paralleled the ability of the parent compounds (aminopterin greater than methotrexate greater than folate greater than p-aminobenzoylglutamate) to act as reversible transport inhibitors. Measurements at 4 degrees C showed that activated methotrexate (Ki = 0.8 microM) was a competitive inhibitor for binding of methotrexate (KD = 0.4 microM) to the transport protein. Treatment of the cells with sufficient activated methotrexate to inhibit transport increased the KD for methotrexate to 0.9 microM but had no effect on total methotrexate-binding activity. Methotrexate efflux was also reduced but was not blocked by an excess of this reagent.'

aS'Membranes may be prepared from A-431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells which have the ability to bind 125I-labeled epidermal growth factor (EGF) in a specific manner and which, in the presence of EGF, catalyze the phosphorylation of a number of endogenous membrane proteins. The activation of the membrane associated protein kinase by EGF appears to be a reversible phenomenon. The membrane preparation may be solubilized by a number of nonionic detergents with the retention of both 125I-labeled EGF-binding activity and EGF-enhanced phosphorylation of specific membrane proteins. The solubilized membrane preparation may be purified by affinity chromatography using EGF covalently linked to Affi-Gel. The purified preparation retains both EGF-binding activity and EGF-enhanced phosphorylation activity. Analysis of the affinity-purified preparation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis indicates the presence of one major protein band of molecular weight 150,000 and several trace bands. The evidence suggests that the major 150,000 protein band is the receptor for EGF and is a substrate of the phosphorylation reaction. The co-purification of EGF-binding activity and EGF-stimulated phosphorylation activity suggests an inherent close relationship.'

aS'The structural organization of a family of repeated DNA sequences in the chicken genome has been determined by hybridization of a cloned repeated DNA sequence to Southern blots of total DNA. The length of the cloned DNA fragment is 3600 nucleotide pairs. This fragment consists principally, if not entirely, of a single repeated DNA sequence occurring only once within the cloned fragment. In the chicken genome, the family of repeated DNA sequences homologous to the cloned sequence has a limited number of alternative forms. Some of the restriction fragments of total DNA to which the cloned sequence hybridizes correspond to those expected from the location of restriction endonuclease cleavage sites within the cloned sequence. There are also a limited number of other genomic restriction fragments, each present in multiple copies, to which the cloned sequence hybridizes but which do not relate in any obvious way to the length of the cloned sequence. These various restriction fragments differ from one another in that they appear to be present in unequal amounts in total DNA, and many of them do not contain the entire cloned sequence. This study provides some new information about the structure of repeated DNA sequences in the chicken genome. The copies of a repeated DNA sequence may differ from one another both by minor variations in nucleotide sequence (divergence) and in more substantial ways as would be expected to arise from processes such as insertion, deletion, and translocation. In addition to this description of a single cloned repeated DNA sequence from the chicken genome, this paper reports the cloning of more than 100 different restriction fragments of chicken DNA, each of which contains one or more repeated DNA sequences.'

aS'The presence of both single copy sequences and repeated DNA sequences with a broad range of repetition frequency is a hallmark of the eukaryotic genome. The advent of recombinant DNA technology has made it possible to isolate cloned DNA fragments that encompass two or more DNA sequences with different repetition frequencies. This provides the first opportunity to investigate the structural relationships in the genome of DNA of the different repetition frequency classes in a thorough and systematic way. A cloned fragment of the chicken genome containing two different repeated DNA sequences has been used for this purpose. By hybridization of radioactive restriction fragments of the cloned DNA to filter-bound restriction fragments of total chicken DNA, it has been determined that the 5.5-kilobase inserted DNA in this clone contains a copy of each of two long, repeated DNA sequence elements with different repetition frequencies. These two repeated DNA sequences have very diverse arrangements in the chicken genome. The results establish that, in addition to the interspersion of single copy and repeated DNA sequences in the chicken genome, repeated DNA sequences with very different structural characteristics can be interspersed with one another. Thus, the chicken genome is a complex network of related sequences in which some members of a family of repeated DNA sequences are associated with other, nonhomologous repeated DNA sequences, while other members of the same family are flanked by single copy DNA.'

aS'Swiss mouse 3T3 fibroblasts were grown in tissue culture, fixed with lysine-paraformaldehyde-periodate solutions containing 0 to 0.1% Tween 20, and then stained for cyclooxygenase antigenicity using rabbit anti-cyclooxygenase IgG in the peroxidase anti-peroxidase procedure. When examined by light microscopy, those cells fixed in the presence of 0.03 to 0.1% Tween 20 exhibited staining throughout the cytoplasm and around the nucleus but not on the cell surface. No staining occurred when either preimmune IgG or anti-cyclooxygenase IgG adsorbed with purified enzyme was substituted for the immune IgG. Electron microscopic examination of cells treated with fixative containing 0.05% Tween 20 and then stained for cyclooxygenase antigenicity revealed electron-dense deposits on the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear membrane but not the mitochondrial or plasma membranes. No staining was seen in cells treated with control sera. Agents such as angiotensin II, bradykinin, antidiuretic hormone, and thrombin interact, apparently with the 3T3 cell surface to cause a release of arachidonic acid and prostaglandin E2 formation (Pong, S.S., Hong, S. L., and Levine, L. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 1408-1413). Our results establish that conversion of arachidonic acid to the prostaglandin endoperoxide precursor of PGE2 actually takes place on the endoplasmic reticulum and the nuclear envelope.'

We describe the use of high voltage paper electrophoresis in borate for the resolution of seven glycopeptides from ovalbumin and seven glycopeptides from human immunoglobulin G.

aS'Elevated concentrations of potassium chloride (50 to 120 mM) in the incubation medium stimulated in vitro discharge of secretory protein from guinea pig pancreatic lobules. The effect of potassium was not inhibited by 10(-4) M atropine, sodium substitutes, or 10(-5) M tetrodotoxin. Exposure of lobules to elevated concentrations of potassium chloride did not increase the release of tissue lactic dehydrogenase and resulted in the appearance of exocytotic images detected by electron microscopy. The time course and extent of discharge due to 75 mM KCl were similar to those caused by the ionophore A23187 and the secretory effect of both agents depended on extracellular calcium and intracellular energy reserves. Potassium chloride stimulation of 75 mM increased the influx of extracellular calcium by 49%, as measured by net 45Ca uptake. Optimal carbamylcholine chloride or pancreozymin stimulation consistently showed a greater effect on discharge than optimal KCl or A23187 stimulation and the additional effect depended on the ability of these physiological secretagogues to recruit calcium from intracellular sources. Potassium chloride stimulation did not result in cyclic GMP elevations in the presence of atropine and those elevations due to A23187 stimulation were small (21 to 30%) and dissimilar both in character (calcium dependence) and time course compared to those resulting from the physiological secretagogues. These findings allow us to define two interrelated pathways which couple hormonal stimulation and discharge of secretory protein in the exocrine pancreas.'

aS"Linear simian virus 40 DNA has been transcribed in vitro with wheat germ RNA polymerase II. Transcription products have been fractionated on polyacrylamide gels and several discrete sized RNA bands are seen. The RNA band pattern is affected dramatically by deoxyribonuclease treatment during RNA isolation. This is because most of the RNA synthesized is covalently linked to DNA. This linkage has been demonstrated by density analysis in formaldehyde-CsCl gradients and by incorporation of alkali-stable ribonucleotides into DNA. The linear DNA templates transcribed were generated by treatment of circular DNA with restriction enzymes which, in addition to cutting once at a single primary site, were found also to produce single strand nicks at specific secondary sites. The discrete sized RNA bands observed result from initiation at these nicks and terminated at DNA ends. There are two modes of nick-dependent initiation. In one mode the 3'-hydroxyl terminus of the DNA at a single strand nick serves as a primer for the extension of an RNA chain. In a second mode de novo initiation of an RNA chain is promoted at the nick. RNAs which are not primed initiate predominantly with GTP. The catalytic action of wheat germ RNA polymerase II is similar to that of Escherichia coli core RNA polymerase which has also been shown to synthesize primarily RNA which is covalently linked to DNA."

aS'Two forms of DNA-dependent ATPase activity have been purified from yeast extracts. The two ATPases differ from each other in chromatographic properties and heat stabilities but have similar molecular weight and reaction properties. DNA-dependent ATPase I has been purified to near homogeneity, while DNA-dependent ATPase II is only partially purified. The two ATPases from yeast are related structurally since antiserum raised against ATPase I cross-react against ATPase II. Yeast DNA-dependent ATPase I has a native molecular weight of about 68,000 and consists of a single polypeptide chain. ATPase II also sediments on sucrose gradient as a 68,000-dalton protein. Both yeast DNA-dependent ATPases hydrolyze dNTPs and rNTPs to their corresponding nucleoside diphosphates and orthophosphate, but dATP and ATP are preferred substrates. In addition to nucleoside triphosphates, both enzymes require a divalent cation and a polynucleotide for activity. Single-stranded DNAs and polydeoxynucleotides are the most effective co-substrates for yeast DNA-dependent ATPases. Addition of yeast DNA-dependent ATPases to DNA synthesis system containing yeast DNA polymerases does not significantly stimulate the rate of DNA synthesis.'

The digestion patterns indicated the presence of a base-paired structure within a conserved 3'-terminal sequence. This structure corresponds to the 3'-proximal hairpin configuration suggested previously for the small subunit rRNAs of Escherichia coli, yeast, rat, and silkworm on the basis of their nucleotide sequences."

aS'Actin polypeptides are the most abundant protein components of replicating normal human T lymphocytes, comprising 16% of the total cellular protein. Unlike other replicating cell types which synthesize equal proportions of beta- and gamma-actin polypeptides, T cells synthesize beta-actin as the predominant species. By contrast, leukemic T cells (the Molt-4 cell line) synthesize nearly equal proportions of beta- and gamma-actin. In addition, novel forms of beta-actin in normal T cells and of beta- and gamma-actin in Molt-4 cells appear to be present, perhaps resulting from a post-translational modification process. Otherwise, both divergent T cell types express a relatively common spectrum of polypeptide species, thereby suggesting that regulation of actin biosynthesis may be involved in the neoplastic transformation process.'

aS'Mouse IgA 47A is an immunoglobulin variant whose heavy (alpha) chain has a molecular weight of 40,000 and lacks the entire CH3 domain. In order to understand better the mechanism by which the CH3 domain is lost, the 47A heavy chain mRNA has been partially purified. The mRNA migrated as a 17 S species on sucrose gradients and coded for the cell-free synthesis of only one serologically reactive protein with an apparent molecular weight of 42,000. Competitive inhibition of immunoprecipitation and tryptic peptide analysis of a cyanogen bromide fragment of the in vitro product revealed significant homology between the authentically secreted heavy chain and the respective cell-free synthesized, immunoprecipitated product. The heavy chain mRNA of 47A possessed a chain length of about 2200 nucleotides which is the same size as a normal alpha heavy chain mRNA, thus demonstrating that the protein deletion is not due to a large deletion at the mRNA level. The deletion in the 47A heavy chain may be due to a frameshift of a single nucleotide followed by premature chain termination.'

aS'Purified Ca2+-ATPase from rabbit skeletal muscle has been incorporated into intact erythrocyte membranes by a two-step procedure. The isolated protein was reconstituted into proteoliposomes composed of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, and cardiolipin (50:20:30%, respectively). The resulting proteoliposomes were fused with erythrocytes in presence of La3+, Ca2+, or Mg2+. Subsequently, 45Ca uptake into the cells could be demonstrated. It was dependent on externally added ATP, inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide and p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, and enhanced by inactivation of the endogenous Ca2+-ATPase which catalyzes Ca2+ extrusion from the cells. The insertion of the protein did not induce cell lysis, but the cells did become more fragile. Functional insertion of isolated membrane proteins into cell membranes allows a new approach to research of plasma membranes.'

aS'In the fungus Podospora anserina, a double mutant strain which combines two ribosomal mutations exhibits a marked sensitivity to NH4+ acetate. Mutations which suppress this phenotype were isolated. Two mutants were found to have an electrophoretically altered ribosomal protein. In one mutant, protein S15 from the small subunit has a reduced charge; in the other, the 60 S protein L16 is shorter than the homologous wild type protein. Both mutant and wild type proteins are present in heterokaryotic strains combining mutant and wild type nuclei. We therefore propose that the alteration of S15 and L16 results from mutations in the structural genes for these proteins.'

aS'A new EPR signal from Cu2+ has been discovered in reductive experiments with type 2 copper-depleted laccase from Polyporus versicolor. A novel EPR signal has also been found in native laccase from Rhus vernicifera on oxidation of the reduced protein with H2O2. In reoxidation experiments with cytochrome c oxidase from beef heart, a new Cu2+ signal has been observed. With Rhus laccase, the new signal is shown to originate from one of the copper ions that are nondetectable in the resting enzyme, and evidence is presented for the signals in Polyporus laccase and cytochrome c oxidase also stemming from the metal pairs that are antiferromagnetically coupled in the oxidized enzymes. The new signals show strong rhombic character, and the EPR parameters place them in a category different from the signals of type 1 as well as of type 2 Cu2+ ions.'

aS'In previous studies, it was shown that a 4600-dalton pyruvate-containing peptide is released from proline reductase by mild alkali treatment. The alkali-sensitive bond proved to be between Ser-Glu, and it was suggested that an ester, rather than a peptide linkage, might be involved. In the present study, the effects of additional esterolytic reagents, (I) LiBH4 and (II) NH2OH, on proline reductase have been investigated and compared with 0.1 N NaOH-induced cleavage. Treatment with reagents I and II released a peptide identical with the peptide released by alkali as judged by electrophoretic mobility on thin layer sheets, COOH-terminal analyses, and amino acid compositional studies. The glutamic acid residue is converted to alpha-amino-delta-hydroxyvaleric acid after reductive cleavage with LiBH4. The liberation of the peptide fragment by the relatively specific esterolytic reagent, LiBH4, provides additional support of the presence of an ester linkage in native proline reductase.'

aS'The apparent glutathione oxidase activity of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase is due to nonenzymatic oxidation and transhydrogenation reactions of cysteinylglycine, an enzymatic product formed from glutathione by hydrolysis or autotranspeptidation. Since cysteinylglycine reacts with oxygen more rapidly than does glutathione, the rate of disulfide formation is increased and either cystinyl-bis-glycine or the mixed disulfide of cysteinylglycine and glutathione forms as an intermediate product. Nonenzymatic transhydrogenation reactions of these disulfides with glutathione yield glutathione disulfide and thus account for the apparent glutathione oxidase activity of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. A sensitive assay for glutathione oxidation is described, and it is shown that covalent inhibitors of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase abolish the oxidase activity of the purified enzyme and of crude homogenates of mouse and rat kidney.'

aS'Digitonin-solubilized turkey erythrocyte beta-adrenergic receptors were reconstituted by dialysis into human erythrocyte acceptor membranes which lack beta receptors. Incorporation of turkey beta receptors into acceptor membranes was directly proportional to the quantity of soluble protein added to the reconstitution system. Reconstituted beta receptors demonstrate saturable [125I]iodohydroxybenzylpindolol binding (Bmax = 11.1 +/- 0.8 fmol/mg, K = 77.8 +/- 8.6 pM) and stereospecificity ((-)-propranolol, K = 11.0 nM; (+)-propranolol, K = 2000 nM; (-)-isoproterenol, K = 250 nM; (+)-isoproterenol, K = 82 micro M). Reconstituted beta receptors appear to be incorporated into acceptor membranes as integral proteins. Reconstituted beta receptors cannot be extracted by high salt or pH (3 to 11); detergent is required for resolubilization of reconstituted beta receptors. Adenylate cyclase stimulation was not obtained in reconstituted membranes since acceptor membranes lack a catalytic subunit. However, guanine nucleotide regulation of agonist affinity was observed indicating a functional reconstitution. GTP (100 micro M) produces a 5-fold decrease in the affinity of isoproterenol for reconstituted beta receptors. Experiments with sulfhydryl reagents indicate that the reconstituted beta receptor couples with the guanine nucleotide regulatory protein of the acceptor membranes. These data describe the successful reconstitution of a beta receptor and indicate that the reconstituted beta receptor can interact with the GTP binding protein of human erythrocyte acceptor membranes.'

aS'The ESR spin-trapping technique has been used to identify a free radical involved in the oxygenation of arachidonic acid by ram seminal vesicle microsomes. The ESR spectrum of the radical adduct indicates that a carbon-centered arachidonic acid free radical has been observed. The formation of this species is inhibited by indomethacin, but not by phenol, and it is probably the first intermediate formed during the prostaglandin synthetase-catalyzed oxidation of arachidonic acid. The chemical identity of the trapped radical was substantiated with an independent synthesis of a closely related radical adduct.'

aS'A new method is described for the estimation of the percentages of free steroids in undiluted serum or plasma. Samples were incubated with 3H-steroid and [14C]glucose, and duplicate aliquots of the mixture were subjected to centrifugal ultrafiltration through a dialysis membrane at 37 degrees C. The percentages of free estradiol, testosterone, and progesterone in serum were estimated by comparing the ratio of 3H-steroid to [14C]glucose in the ultrafiltrate with the corresponding ratio in the serum retained by the dialysis membrane. In addition to being highly reproducible, the present method affords several advantages over existing methods. The use of [14C]glucose to monitor the movement of unbound serum components obviates measurement of the ultrafiltrate volume, and because the ultrafiltrate remains in contact with the dialysis membrane, small molecular weight components are able to pass through the dialysis membrane in either direction during centrifugal ultrafiltration. This latter feature, which could be described as "isodialysis," allows the estimation of the percentage of free steroid under conditions which closely approximate the in vivo situation.'

aS'13N- and 15N-labeling experiments were carried out with Paracoccus denitrificans, grown anaerobically on nitrate, to determine whether hyponitrite might be an obligatory intermediate in denitrification and a precursor of nitrous oxide. From experiments designed to trap [13N]- or [15N,15N]hyponitrite by dilution into authentic hyponitrite it was calculated that the intracellular concentration of a presumptive hyponitrite pool must be less than 0.4 mM. In order for a pool of this size to turn over rapidly enough to handle the flux of nitrogen during dentrifucation, the spontaneous rate of hyponitrite dehydration must be enhanced by a factor of several thousand through enzyme catalysis. Cell extracts failed to catalyze this reaction under a variety of conditions. It is concluded that hyponitrite cannot be an intermediate in dentrification. In addition, the assimilation of inorganic nitrogen was studied in P. denitrificans using 13N as tracer. At low concentrations (less than 10(-8) M) of labeled nitrate and nitrite 5 to 10% of the label was assimilated into non-volatile metabolites and 90 to 95% was reduced to N2. Similarly, with 15 mM [13N]nitrate, 5% of the label went into metabolites and 95% to N2. High pressure liquid chromatography analysis of the labeled metabolites indicated that the major pathway for assimilation of inorganic nitrogen in P. denitrificans under these conditions is through ammonia incorporation via the aspartase reaction.'

aS"Treatment of HeLa cells with interferon results in the induction of an enzymatic activity designated 2'5'oligo(A) polymerase. The polymerase requires continuous presence of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) for activity, since degradation of dsRNA abolishes synthesis of the oligomeric series pppA(2'p5'A)n. These oligonucleotides are formed initially at a constant rate with dimer synthesized faster than trimer, and the latter faster than tetramer. After 45 min, accumulation of the dimer declines whereas that of other oligomers still proceeds at a linear rate. These results suggest that an oligomer remains associated with the enzyme for possible consecutive additions of adenylate, since no significant accumulation of dimer precedes synthesis of trimer. The relative amounts of the different oligomers found at the end of a reaction may reflect an increasing probability of release as the oligomers are elongated. The accumulation of dimer, however, decreases when it becomes a substrate for adenylate addition; incorporation of isolated dimer into 2'5'-oligo(A) was directly shown. Other nucleotides with a blocked p5'A terminus, like A5'ppppp5'A and NADH, can serve as adenylate acceptors in the presence of dsRNA. The adenosine triphosphates 2'-dATP and 3'-dATP are not incorporated efficiently into 2'5'-oligo(A) and inhibit its synthesis."

aS'Pure phosphoglycerate kinase from young and old rat muscle shows substantial differences in properties. Compared to the "young" enzyme, phosphoglycerate kinase isolated from old animals possesses a greater stability to heat and storage, a slower reacting -SH group, an altered UV spectrum, and requires more antiserum prepared to "young" enzyme for 50% inactivation. Km and specific activity are unchanged. Immunotitration experiments show evidence for an age-related alteration of the enzyme in liver and brain, but not in kidney, lung, or heart. Loss of NH2- or COOH-terminal amino acids is not responsible for the observed differences in the properties of "young" and "old" muscle phosphoglycerate kinase. Both forms of the enzyme contain a blocked (presumably acylated) NH2-terminal residue and the sequence of the three COOH-terminal residues (Ala-Val-Leu-COOH) is identical. Moreover, isoelectric focusing of the two enzyme forms of both acrylamide gels and in a sucrose gradient failed to detect evidence of deamidation or other charge-altering differences. We conclude that, like enolase from aged nematodes, muscle phosphoglycerate kinase becomes altered in conformation in old rats.'

aS'The benzoate 1,2-dioxygenase system of Pseudomonas arvilla consists of two proteins, an NADH-cytochrome c reductase and an oxygenase. The oxygenase component was purified to apparent homogeneity by the criteria of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis from benzoate-induced cells of P. arvilla. The molecular weight of the enzyme was determined to be 273,000 by sedimentation equilibrium analysis, 280,000 by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels of different concentrations, and 270,000 by Sepharose CL-6B gel filtration, respectively. The sedimentation coefficient, the Stokes radius, and the partial specific volume of the enzyme were calculated to be 10.0 S, 56 A, and 0.72 ml/g, respectively. The isoelectric point of the enzyme was estimated to be pH 4.5. The enzyme contained about 10 mol of iron and about 8 mol of labile sulfide/mol of enzyme. The iron-sulfur clusters of the enzyme were suggested to be (2Fe-2S*) from cluster-extrusion experiments (S*, sulfide, acid-labile sulfur). No significant amounts of heme or flavin were detected in the enzyme. The enzyme exhibited absorption spectrum with maxima at 279, 325, and 464 nm. The turnover number of the enzyme in the presence of saturating amounts of NADH-cytochrome c reductase, the other component of the benzoate 1,2-dioxygenase system, was calculated to be 22,000 at 24 degrees C. The apparent Km values for the reductase, benzoate, and molecular oxygen were 26 (0.97 mg of protein/ml), 3.9, and 4.3 microM, respectively.'

aS'Porcine pancreatic lipase was inhibited by alkane and arene boronic acids. The inhibition by octadecane boronic acid was competitive when measured against the hydrolysis of dissolved tripropionin in the presence of siliconized glass beads. The value of Ki in this system was 1.34 x 10(3) molecules micron-2. The ratio of substrate to inhibitor concentrations giving 50% inhibition was in the range of 700 to 2200, indicating that lipase has a greater affinity for boronic acids than for tripropionin. Boronic acids did not interfere with the interaction of lipase with the siliconized glass/water interface, demonstrating that the binding of lipase to substrate interfaces, the first step in lipase action, was not the step at which inhibition occurred. The boronic acid binding site on lipase is at or near the active center serine since modification of this residue by diethyl p-nitrophenyl phosphate was prevented by boronic acids. Modification of the active center serine residue by diethyl p-nitrophenyl phosphate also prevented boronic acid binding. Binding of a chromophoric boronic acid, 7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazolyl m-aminobenzene boronic acid, to lipase was demonstrated by equilibrium gel filtration on polyacrylamide beads (Bio-Gel P-60) in the presence of 4 mM sodium taurodeoxycholate. The complex contained 1 molecule of boronic acid per molecule of lipase and had a dissociation constant Kd of 5 x 10(-6) M. The boronic acid was not bound in the absence of taurodeoxycholate. Boronic acids are believed to be analogs of the tetrahedral intermediate in the action of lipase.'

aS'The membrane-bound Enzyme IIbgl and IIglc are both inactivated in vivo by the sulfhydryl reagent N-ethylmaleimide. The former is also inhibited by the hydrophilic sulfhydryl reagents p-chloromercuribenzoic acid and p-mercuriphenylsulfonic acid, while the latter is resistant to these reagents. However, inhibition of this enzyme is observed after impairment, either transient or permanent, of the permeability barrier of bacterial envelopes. Since p-chloromercuribenzoic acid and p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid are able to cross the outer membrane of Escherichia coli, their failure to inhibit in vivo Enzyme IIglc must be due to their inability to cross the inner membrane of the bacteria. It would therefore appear that sensitive thiol group(s) of Enzyme IIglc and Enzyme IIbgl, in spite of their functional similarity, exhibit opposite orientation within the cytoplasmic membrane, the first enzyme having an -SH group accessible from the outer surface of the membrane, while the second has an -SH group accessible from the inner surface of the membrane. The present results strengthen the view that these two enzymes have in asymmetric orientation within the membrane as already suggested by their vectorial function.'

aS'Single crystal x-ray diffraction studies are proceeding on two phycobiliproteins: C-Phycocyanin from Anabaena variabilis and B-Phycoerythrin from Porphyridium cruentum. C-Phycocyanin consists of six alpha and six beta subunits. A three-dimensional x-ray diffraction study of this light-harvesting protein (P6(3); a = b = 154.1 A, c = 40.1 A) at 5-A resolution shows that the molecule is 110 A in diameter, 40 A thick, with a 20-A diameter central channel. It can be divided into three separate domains related by the crystallographic 3 and contains long, columnar regions of density, presumed to represent alpha helix. B-Phycoerythrin is composed of 6 alpha, 6 beta, and a gamma subunit. A 5.25-A resolution study of this protein (R3, a = b = 189 A, c = 60 A) indicates that the molecule is 107 A in diameter and 55 A thick, has 32-D3 symmetry, and can be divided into six regions. The gamma chain lies on a crystallographic 3 and undergoes symmetric disordering. A region of low and unstructured density in the center of the molecule is presumably occupied by this gamma chains. These two low resolution structures are compared with regard to differences in quaternary structure.'

aS'Human antithrombin III has been shown to contain four identical N-glycosidically linked carbohydrate chain per molecule. These carbohydrate chains have been investigated by sugar and methylation analysis before and after removal of N-acetylneuraminic acid residues. The chains have been further investigated by Smith degradation, trifluoroacetolytic degradation, and degradation after chromium trioxide oxidation. As a result of these studies, the following structures is proposed for the carbohydrate chains in human antithrombin III: (formula: see text). NeuNAc, N-acetylneuraminic acid; Galp, galactopyranose; GlcNAcp, 2-acetamido-2-deoxyglucopyranose; Manp, mannopyranose are the abbreviations used in the structure.'

aS'The substrate specificity of O-sulfotransferases involved in the biosynthesis of heparin was studied by incubating exogenous polysaccharide acceptors with mouse mastocytoma microsomal fraction in the presence of phosphoadenylyl[35S]sulfate. Characterization of the labeled products showed that O-sulfation occurs preferentially in the vicinity of N-sulfate groups; that 2-O-sulfation of L-iduronic acid residues occurs preferentially or exclusively in the absence of a 6-O-sulfate group on adjacent D-glucosamine units; and that 6-O-sulfation of D-glucosamine residues occurs readily in the presence of 2-O-sulfate groups on adjacent L-iduronic acid units. Furthermore, structural analysis of microsomal heparin-precursor polysaccharides showed a distinct intermediate species that contained 2-O-sulfated L-iduronic acid units but essentially no 6-O-sulfate groups on the (N-sulfated) D-glucosamine residues. The results suggest that 2-O-sulfation of L-iduronic acid units is tightly coupled to the formation of these units (by 5-epimerization of D-glucuronic acid residues) and, furthermore, that both processes are completed before 6-O-sulfation of the polysaccharide molecule is initiated. D-Glucuronosyl 5-epimerization not accompanied by 2-O-sulfation occurs at a still earlier stage of polymer modification; the resulting L-iduronic acid units appear to remain nonsulfated throughout the subsequent modification reactions.'

aS'Saturated phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylglycerol are important components of pulmonary surface active material. We studied the synthesis of these two phospholipid classes by alveolar type II cells in primary culture. During a 20-h incubation, type II cells incorporated a high percentage of glycerol, acetate, and palmitate into phosphatidylcholine (61.2, 76.4, and 76.8% of lipid radioactivity, respectively) and into phosphatidylglycerol (16.7, 5.8, and 6.6%). Acetate was incorporated principally by de novo synthesis of fatty acids rather than by chain elongation. We studied the pathways for synthesis of saturated phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylglycerol with type II cells that had been in culture for 1 day. Palmitate was incorporated nearly equally into positions 1 and 2 of saturated phosphatidylglycerol, but predominantly (72%) into position 2 of saturated phosphatidylcholine. These data imply that saturated phosphatidylcholine is synthesized at least in part by acylation of 1-acyl-2-lysophosphatidylcholine. Alveolar type II cells also incorporated a mixture of saturated 1-[9,10-3H]palmitoyl-2-lysophosphatidylcholine and 1-acyl-2-lysophosphatidyl-[1,2-14C]choline from the medium by direct acylation rather than by transacylation. As the duration of culture increased beyond 1 day, type II cells incorporated a lower percentage of palmitate into phosphatidylglycerol and saturated phosphatidylcholine.'

aS"A novel endoribonuclease was detected and purified to homogeneity from calf thymus. The homogeneity was checked by analysis in polyacrylamide gels (both in the presence and in the absence of sodium dodecyl sulfate) as well as by isoelectric focusing. This nuclease activity, which is called Endoribonuclease V, cleaves poly(A) and poly(U); other single- or double-stranded synthetic polyribo- as well as polydeoxyribonucleotides are not degraded. Endoribonuclease V cleaves poly(A) to create first oligoribonucleotides and ultimately 3'-AMP; no P-2':3'-Ado degradation products were detected. The enzyme has a pH optimum of 5.8, an isoelectric point of pH 6.3, a molecular weight of 52,300, and requires neither monovalent nor divalent cations. The enzyme activity is not inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide."

aS'The diterpene ester promoter of mouse skin tumors, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), efficiently induces Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated DNA polymerase (DNA nucleotidyltransferase) activity in the EBV-producing lymphoblastoid cell line, P3HR-1. With the use of intervent dilution chromatography followed by sequential DEAE-cellulose and phosphocellulose column chromatography, the virus-associated enzyme has been isolated and purified 300-fold. The partially purified EBV DNA polymerase activity could be distinguished from cellular polymerases by its activation with salt and its degree of sensitivity to N-ethylmaleimide and phosphonoacetic acid. The enzyme showed maximum activity for copying activated calf thymus DNA in the presence of 100 mM ammonium sulfate. In the absence of salt, the enzyme utilized with high efficiency deoxyoligomer-homopolymer templates, but failed to copy poly(rA) . oligo(dT)10 and oligo(dT)10, showing that the enzyme had properties distinct from DNA polymerase gamma, reverse transcriptase, and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase. The partially purified enzyme is strongly inhibited by acyclovir triphosphate and thus has properties similar to herpes simplex virus DNA polymerase.'

aS'Nine oligosaccharide fractions were purified from the urine of mannosidosis patients by Bio-Gel P-4 column chromatography, paper chromatography, and paper electrophoresis. Studies using exoglycosidase digestion, methylation analysis, periodate oxidation, and acetolysis revealed that most of the fractions were mixtures of two or three isomeric oligosaccharides. The structures of a total of 16 oligosaccharides were elucidated to be as follows: (formula: see text).'

aS'A fully kinetoplastic strain of an antigenic variant of Trypanosoma equiperdum has been made dyskinetoplastic by successive treatments of infected rats with ethidium bromide or acriflavine. After seven passages in the absence of the dye, the loss of kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) is stable and complete as shown by analytical ultracentrifugation, CsCl-dye gradients, and the reassociation kinetics of in vitro-labeled kDNA. Moreover, these trypanosomes exhibit the same infectivity as the wild type. These results suggest that neither the minicircles nor the maxicircles of the kDNA network are essential to the viability and the pathogenicity of blood-stream trypanosomes.'

aS"Replacement of 7-azatryptophan for tryptophan in two positions on the catalytic chain of aspartate transcarbamylase results in changes in the enzyme's homotropic and heterotropic interactions although there is no change in the enzyme's specific activity. The extent of azatryptophan incorporation was quantitated by amino acid analysis which showed that 85% of the tryptophan residues had been replaced. The substituted enzyme is activated by ATP and inhibited by CTP to a greater extent than is the native enzyme. The aspartate saturation curve in the presence of ATP is identical for the two enzymes, but the curve in the presence of CTP and without effectors is shifted toward higher aspartate concentrations for the azatryptophan-substituted enzyme. At low aspartate concentrations, the native enzyme is activated to a greater extent by the substrate analog succinate. These data suggest that the substitution renders the low substrate affinity conformational state of the enzyme less catalytically efficient. This interpretation is in agreement with possible side chain interactions observed in the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme."

aS'Phosphatidylkojibiosyl diacylglycerol functions as the acceptor of sn-glycerol 1-phosphate moieties from phosphatidylglycerol in the in vitro synthesis of the membrane lipoteichoic acid of Streptococcus faecium (S. faecalis ATCC 9790). The enzyme catalyzing this polymer-forming reaction is membrane-bound. The majority of the product is water-soluble, is excluded from Sepharose 6B, and, after longer incubations, changes to a form that co-precipitates with protein upon exposure to a denaturing agent. These properties are shared by the polyglycerol phosphate-containing membrane lipoteichoic acid isolated from whole cells of S. faecium. However, unlike the lipoteichoic acid generated in vivo, the glycerol phosphate polymer portion of the product synthesized in vitro is not substituted and, therefore, is considered a nascent lipoteichoic acid intermediate.'

aS'Rat liver ferritins consist of families of isoferritins fashioned from different proportions of two subunit types, H and L. Iron administration alters both the absolute and the relative amounts of these isoferritins through an increase in L-rich forms. This phenotype change represents preferential synthesis of L-rich isoferritins together with a faster degradation of H-rich isoferritins. The turnover rates of isoferritins in the same liver are markedly different and vary progressively with subunit composition. The H and L subunits in individual isoferritins appear to turn over at similar rates, suggesting that the various isoferritins are degraded as intact shells rather than through exchange and degradation of subunits.'

aS'Treatment of erythrocytes with the divalent cation ionophore A23187 results in net uptake of calcium and a calcium-dependent decrease in cellular potassium content and cell volume. These changes in membrane properties are associated with a selective stimulation of fatty acid incorporation into membrane phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). In this study the relationship between this selective stimulation of phospholipid fatty acid turnover and changes in calcium uptake, cellular potassium content, and cell volume has been examined by 1) preventing the calcium-dependent loss of potassium without abolishing calcium uptake and 2) altering cellular potassium content and cell volume without increasing net uptake of calcium by utilizing the monovalent cation inonophore nigericin or increasing the osmolarity of the buffer. It has been shown that treatment of erythrocytes with A23187, nigericin, or hypertonic buffer results in a selective stimulation of fatty acid incorporation into PE. These results suggest that a mechanical or conformational change in the membrane is associated with a selective stimulation of fatty acid turnover in phosphatidylethanolamine.'

aS'A DNA-dependent ATPase with a molecular weight of 63,000 has been purified to near homogeneity from T4-infected Escherichia coli. This enzyme is not present in uninfected E. coli. It is present in E. coli infected with amber mutants of gene 44 or gene 62 and with the data mutant. The enzyme can be eluted from single-stranded DNA-cellulose at NaCl molarities greater than 0.6 M and from ATP agarose with 80 mM MgATP. The enzyme hydrolyzes MgATP or MgdATP to the diphosphates with equal maximum velocities and the Km values are 0.30 and 0.75 mM, respectively. The enzyme hydrolyzes MgCTP with 13% and MgUTP with 7% of the velocity observed with MgATP. Apparent Km values are reported for single-stranded T4 DNA and for a series of synthetic polynucleotides. The 63,000-dalton enzyme can be cleaved proteolytically to an active 22,000-dalton form. This can be demonstrated by storage of infected cells, by mixing of cell extracts, and by inhibition with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The Mr = 22,000 enzyme cross-reacts with antibody made to the Mr = 63,000 enzyme. This antibody inhibits the 22,000-dalton species. The 22,000-dalton enzyme forms a complex with gene 32 protein in the absence of DNA.'

aS'Submitochondrial particles obtained from skeletal muscle are open membrane fragments which show energy coupling yet cannot sustain transmembrane ion gradients. An energy-linked decrease in fluorescence emission of the fluorescent probe quinacrine is observed with skeletal muscle particles which is enhanced by the anion SCN-. This is essentially the same reaction observed with beef heart submitochondrial particles, in which the reaction is known to be a monitor of intramembrane H+ transfer. The results with skeletal muscle particles show that this intramembrane H+ transfer occurs in the absence of any electrochemical potential across the membrane. Further, it occurs independently of the direction of H+ exchange with the suspendingly medium, since energization of skeletal muscle submitochondrial particles is known to give H+ efflux into the medium, while energization of beef heart particles gives H+ uptake from the medium. We conclude that a primary reaction of energy coupling is intramembrane H+ transfer linked to electron transport but shielded from the suspending medium. Movements of H+ between membrane and medium are secondary reactions derived from the primary one, possibly linked by a series of intramembrane conformational changes comprising a sequential membrane Bohr effect.'

aS'Rabbits were made anemic to different extents by phenylhydrazine injections so as to vary the developmental stages of the erythroid cells in their peripheral blood and bone marrow. It was found that the more severe the anemia, the lower the concentration of glycerate-2,3-P2 in the bone marrow cells and in the circulating erythroid cells. The glycerate-2,3-P2 level was shown to rise during erythroid differentiation in a linear relationship to the hemoglobin level, corresponding to the equation Y = 0.03x + 0.29, where y is the concentration of glycerate-2,3-P2 (micromoles per ml packed cells) and x is the concentration of hemoglobin (milligrams per packed cells). The bone marrow cells were fractionated on a size (i.e. maturity) basis and enzyme activities in the fractionated cells were measured. The accumulation of glycerate-2,3-P2 was found to be primarily attributable to the increase in glycerate-2,3-P2 synthase activity. Glycerate-2,3-P2 phosphatase and phosphofructokinase increased as the cells matured from the polychromatic stages to become reticulocytes while pyruvate kinase and phosphoglyceromutase decreased. The changes in phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase appear to be advantageous for glycerate-2,3-P2 accumulation. The two enzyme activities directly responsible for the synthesis and the breakdown of glycerate-2,3-P2 are probably manifested by a single protein, glycerate-2,3-P2 synthase-phosphatase.'

aS'The fibroblast is a differentiated mesenchymal cell which produces and exports collagen, a macromolecule that plays a critical structural role in the function of most organs. To evaluate the control soft tissue fibroblasts have over collagen production, HFL-1, a diploid human lung cell strain, was studied during periods of rapid cell growth and relatively slow growth over 25 population doublings. To minimize environmental influences, the extracellular milieu of the cells was kept constant throughout the study period. Rates of collagen production per cell per unit time were quantitated by labeling HFL-1 with [14C]proline and measuring the production of [14C]hydroxyproline after taking into consideration the specific activity of [14C]proline within the free intracelllular proline pool and the per cent hydroxylation of proline residues in newly synthesized collagen. Although the specific activity of intracellular free proline and the per cent hydroxylation of proline in collagen varied considerably depending on the growth rates of the cells, collagen production by HFL-1 was constant, even during periods of rapid cell growth. Thus, under conditions of a stable environment, populations of soft tissue fibroblasts rigidly control their collagen production. In cultures that maintained a constant doubling time, this stability was maintained over at least 25 population doublings, suggesting that on the average, collagen production appears to be tightly controlled and dissociated from the events and sequelae of cell division.'

aS'Conformational difference surrounding the coenzyme, FAD, of D-amino acid oxidase (D-amino-acid:O2 oxidoreductase (deaminating), EC 1.4.3.3) between its monomeric and dimeric forms were examined by observing fluorescence of FAD. The fluorescence lifetimes of the coenzyme was measured directly with a mode-locked Nd:YAG laser and a streak camera in picosecond region. The values of lifetime of FAD fluorescence in the monomer and dimer were 130 +/- 20 ps and 40 +/- 10 ps, respectively. The relative quantum yield of the fluorescence of FAD combined with the protein to that of free FAD depended on the concentration of the enzyme; it was higher at lower concentration. Comparing the lifetime with relative quantum yield of FAD combined with the protein, it is concluded that the fluorescence is quenched mostly by a dynamic process. These results indicate that the distance between the isoalloxazine nucleus and a quencher is nearer in the dimer than in the monomer.'

aS"The kinetic properties of human placental adenosine kinase, purified 3600-fold, were studied. The reaction velocity had an absolute requirement for magnesium and varied with the pH. Maximal activity was observed at pH 6.5 with a Mg2+:ATP ranging from 1:1 to 2:1. High concentrations of Mg2+ or free ATP were inhibitory. Double reciprocal plots of initial velocity studies yielded intersecting lines for both adenosine and MgATP2-. The Michaelis constant was 0.4 micro M for adenosine and 75 micro M for MgATP2-. Inhibition by adenosine was observed at concentrations greater than 2.5 micro M. AMP was a competitive inhibitor with respect to adenosine and a noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to ATP. ADP was a noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to adenosine and ATP. Hyperbolic inhibition was observed during noncompetitive inhibition of adenosine kinase by AMP and ADP. Other purine and pyrimidine nucleoside mono-, di-, and triphosphates were poor inhibitors in general. S-Adenosylhomocysteine and 2'-deoxyadenosine inhibited adenosine kinase. The data suggest that (a) MgATP2- is the true substrate of adenosine kinase, and both pH and [Mg2+] may regulate its activity; (b) the kinetic mechanisms of adenosine kinase is Ordered Bi Bi; and (c) adenosine kinase may be regulated by the concentrations of its products, AMP and ADP, but is relatively insensitive to other purine and pyrimidine nucleotides."

aS'In order to examine the mechanism of the acute response of ureagenesis to amino acid loads, rats were injected intraperitoneally with various doses of a mixture of 20 amino acids. Blood ammonia rose only slightly with doses of 0.5 to 2.0 g/kg, but increased sharply at doses of 3 to 5 g/kg. Carbamyl phosphate synthetase I (EC 2.7.2.5) activity, assayed in intact mitochondria isolated from livers removed 15 min after injection of amino acids, with N-acetylglutamate at its endogenous levels, rose up to 5-fold with increasing doses up to 2 g/kg; no further activation occurred with larger doses. This maximal activity was the same as the activity measured in disrupted mitochondria. Hepatic levels of glutamate and N-acetylglutamate increased approximately linearly with dose of amino acids. The time course of these changes following a dose of 1.5 g/kg was studied. Glutamate, N-acetylglutamate, and carbamyl phosphate synthetase I activity all peaked 5 to 15 min after injection. All of these results were virtually unaltered by omission of arginine from the injected mixture, indicating that the increase in N-acetylglutamate was not attributable to activation by arginine of N-acetylglutamate synthetase. These results indicate that moderate loads of amino acids activate unreagenesis via a rapid increase in N-acetylglutamate levels, secondary to increased mitochondrial glutamate, and independently of injected arginine. This autoregulatory mechanism becomes saturated at large doses of amino acids, and hyperammonemia then supervenes.'

aS'Fourteen clones were isolated in culture from a mouse myeloma, MOPC104E. All clones had kappa and lambda types of light chain mRNAs in approximately equimolar quantity as assayed by hybridization with specific complementary DNA (cDNA). However, the myeloma produces and secretes only lambda-type light chain protein. Both kappa- and lambda-type mRNAs in these clones were indistinguishable from kappa- and lambda-type mRNAs of other myelomas with respect to (a) adsorption to oligo-(dT) cellulose, (b) molecular size (12.6 S), and (c) thermal stability of the hybrids formed with corresponding cDNA. The kappa chain mRNA of MOPC104E cells, however, was translated very inefficiently both in vivo and in vitro, whereas the lambda chain mRNA was translated efficiently. These results indicate that each cell of MOPC104E myeloma synthesizes a crippled kappa chain mRNA in addition to a normal lambda chain mRNA.'

aS'The bile acid-conjugating enzyme cholyl-coenzyme A:glycine/taurine N-acyltransferase previously purified from bovine liver was subjected to a bisubstrate kinetic analysis. Double reciprocal plots of reaction rates as a function of variable concentrations of aminoa acid and cholyl-CoA yielded the nonintersecting type of plots typical of ping-pong reaction mechanisms. A Tetra Uni ping-pong mechanism was supported by further kinetic analysis including demonstration that the enzyme will catalyze the release of CoA from cholyl-CoA without glycine being present. This half-reaction is shown not to be the result of an acyl-CoA thiolase contaminating the N-acyltransferase preparation. The specificity of the enzyme for amino acid was found to be quite narrow; no detectable rate was found for D-Ala, L-Ala, L-Ser, L-Glu-NH2, L-ornithine, or beta-alanine. Activity toward various acyl-CoA derivatives was also tested. Phenylacetyl-CoA, benzoyl-CoA, and acetyl-CoA were not substrates. CoA derivatives of the other common bile acids were very good substrates. Conjugated bile acids were efficient competitive inhibitors of cholyl-CoA binding. Cholic acid also inhibited; however, its inhibition pattern was complex. The enzyme could be reversibly inhibited by p-mercuribenzoate and both cholyl-CoA and glycine protected. N-Ethylmaleimide and iodoacetate were not inhibitory.'

aS'The protein synthesis elongation factor EF-Tu, complexed with EF-Ts, forms part of Q beta RNA replicase. In an effort to determine its function in the RNA synthesis reaction, we have developed procedures which allow us to replace the endogenous EF-Tu in purified Q beta replicase with EF-Tu from a variety of sources. In this communication we report purification of EF-Tu from strains containing (a) a wild type tufA gene only, (b) a kirromycin-resistant mutant tufA gene only, and (c) a kirromycin-resistant mutant tufA gene and a mutant tufB gene which codes for EF-Tu that does not bind ribosomes. When each of these EF-Tu preparations is inserted in Q beta replicase, the wild type tufA gene product and and the tufB gene product function appearently normally, but the kirromycin-resistant tufA gene product causes the formation of an altered enzyme. The Q beta replicase containing kirromycin-resistant EF-Tu is unstable; it is rapidly inactivated in the reaction mixture, even at temperatures as low as 20 degrees C. This property results in an apparent increase in template specificity; while wild type Q beta replicase will transcribe poly(C) and other synthetic RNA species, the mutant enzyme will do so only in the presence of Mn2+, which reduces template specificity. The kirromycin-resistant Q beta replicase will also transcribe Q beta RNA. The results imply that EF-Tu is involved in maintenance of enzyme structure, which, in turn, is implicated in template specificity.'

aS'A theoretical analysis has been derived which allows the analytical calculation of the complete distribution of 18O-labeled Pi species expected to occur during medium Pi equilibrium HOH exchange of [18O]Pi and to be produced by intermediate Pi equilibrium HOH exchange during net hydrolysis of [18O]PPi or other labeled phosphate compounds. The observed distributions with catalysis by yeast inorganic pyrophosphatase are found to agree closely with the theoretical values indicating that the exchange reaction can be adequately described by a unique value of the partitioning of bound Pi between release from the enzyme versus formation of bound PPi with loss of an oxygen to the water. The limitations on the exclusion of other mechanisms are discussed. The extent of this partitioning does change, however, under some experimental conditions. At low pH, with activation by Mg2+ or Mn2+, the relative rate of release of Pi is found to increase. The extent of exchange is also dependent on the nature of the activating metal, being greatest with Co2+. During PPi hydrolysis with PPi in excess over Mg2+, a shift to lower extents of exchange is observed.'

aS'The mechanism of beef heart mitochondrial ATPase (F1) was studied using chromium(III)-substituted substrate analogs. Incubation of F1 with monodentate Cr(III)ADP and 32Pi followed by chromatography on Sephadex G-25 resulted in 32Pi counts in the F1 protein peak. The appearance of radioactivity from inorganic phosphate in the protein peak was dependent upon the presence of monodentate Cr(III)ADP and F1, and was inhibited by MgADP. Removal of the enzyme from the reaction mixture containing Cr(III)ADP and 32Pi by acid precipitation followed by chromatography on Sephadex G-10 indicated the net formation and slow release of a radioactive product. High voltage electrophoresis showed that this product was 32Pi . Cr(III)ADP. Incubation of F1 with bidentate Cr(III)ATP also resulted in formation of this product. These results indicated that non-membrane-bound F1 was capable of net synthesis of what may be an ATP synthesis and hydrolysis transition state analog. The F1-dependent formation of the complex was taken as evidence that the soluble ATPase can function in ATP synthesis as well as ATP hydrolysis.'

aS'The reaction mechanism of melilotate hydroxylase in the presence of 2-OH-cinnamate has been investigated by equilibrium titration, steady state kinetic and rapid reaction kinetic techniques. Analysis of the rapid reaction results for the reoxidation of reduced enzyme . 2-OH-cinnamate complex by molecular oxygen revealed the presence of an intermediate with visible absorption spectrum very similar to that of a C4a-flavin adduct. Repetition of this reoxidation experiment in the presence of 32 mM potassium iodide indicated the sequential appearance of two C4a-flavin adducts. Further analysis of these spectra indicated that hydroxylation of the substrate occurred during the conversion of the first intermediate into the second. Reaction of the oxidized enzyme . 2-OH-cinnamate complex with NADH was saturable in NADH. Oxidized enzyme was converted, in an apparent first order fashion, to a reduced enzyme . NAD charge-transfer-type species which subsequently decayed to reduced enzyme. The turnover number calculated from rapid reaction data was in good agreement with that determined from steady state analyses. Titration and rapid reaction results indicated that at no point in the reaction was there an observable intermediate which contained 2-OH-cinnamate in its phenolate form.'

aS'A beta-galactoside alpha 1 leads to 2 fucosyltransferase has been solubilized from porcine submaxillary glands and purified 124,000-fold to homogeneity by repeated affinity chromatography on GDP-hexanolamine agarose. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified enzyme revealed two electrophoretic species with apparent Mr = 60,000 and 55,000. The two enzyme species have not been completely resolved, but both appear to be active forms of the fucosyltransferase with approximately equal specific activities. Glycosidase digestion of the fucosylated products with the alpha 1 leads to 2-specific fucosidase from Clostridium perfringens and the alpha 1 leads to 3/alpha 1 leads to 4-specific fucosidase from almond emulsin indicates that the enzyme forms exclusively the Fuc alpha 1 leads to 2Gal linkage with a variety of acceptor substrates. A GDP-fucose hydrolase activity co-purifies with the fucosyltransferase. Identical rates of thermal inactivation and co-migration on gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions suggest that the two activities are due to a single enzyme species.'

aS'The acceptor substrate specificity and kinetic properties of the purified porcine submaxillary beta-galactoside alpha 1 leads to 2 fucosyltransferase have been examined. The transferase forms the Fuc alpha 1 leads to 2Gal linkage with oligosaccharides, glycoproteins, and glycolipids which contain nonreducing terminal galactose residues and shows no absolute specificity for a particular penultimate residue or for the linkage between the galactose and the penultimate residue. The fucosyltransferase is active in the absence of divalent metal ions, but it is stimulated upon addition of Mn2+, Mg2+, Ca2+, or Co2+. Kinetic analysis indicates an increase in the Km for both donor and acceptor substrates and in the Vmax in the presence of Mn2+. Initial rate studies and inhibition patterns suggest that the transferase has either a rapid equilibrium random kinetic mechanism or a steady state ordered mechanism with GDP-fucose binding first. Human "Bombay" erythrocytes which lack cell surface Fuc alpha 1 leads to 2Gal structures are fucosylated by the transferase, but expression of H blood group activity is dependent on treatment of the cells with neuraminidase. After neuraminidase digestion, the fucosylated cells are serologically identical to native O-type cells. Analysis of the fucosylated material in the erythrocyte membrane on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis suggests that fucose is incorporated primarily into glycoprotein acceptors.'

aS'Metallothionein was purified under anaerobic conditions from livers of human fetuses ranging from 19 weeks gestational age to term. Homogeneous metallothionein obtained in the absence of reducing agents from the soluble fraction of the tissue which contained 24% and 85% of the total liver copper and zinc, respectively, had less than 1 g atom of copper and about 3.1 g atoms of zinc/mol. Extraction with 1% 2-mercaptoethanol of the insoluble fraction of the tissue (containing 76% and 15% of the liver copper and zinc, respectively) yielded a metallothionein with approximately 2.5 g atoms of copper and 1.3 g atoms of zinc. When the whole tissue was extracted similarly by the procedure of Ryd\xc3\xa9n and Deutsch ((1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 519), nearly equal proportions of the two metals were obtained in the soluble fraction from which metallothionein, with about 3.0 g atoms of zinc and 1.5 g atoms of copper, was purified. Thus, zinc- and copper-rich forms of metallothionein are differently distributed between the soluble and insoluble fractions of fetal liver. Nevertheless, the predominant metal in metallothionein of human fetal liver is zinc as is the case in the adult; significant amounts of copper are also present, consistent with the elevated quantity of this metal in the fetal tissue relative to the adult. Cadmium was not detected. Zinc is much more easily removed from the protein than is copper.'

aS'Membrane fluidity increases within 10 min after fertilization of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and Lytechinus pictus eggs as detected by a decrease in order parameter of the spin label fatty acid 5-doxylstearate. The magnitude of this change is proportional to the fraction of fertilized eggs present. The order parameter decreases when unfertilized eggs are partially activated by ammonia treatment but does not change when the extracellular coats are removed. The increase in membrane fluidity, therefore, appears to be a "late" event in the fertilization program. The increase in fluidity is confined to the polar head group region of the membrane bilayer. Spectral and autoradiographic analyses indicate that the spin label resides in lipid bilayers throughout the cell. Thus, these measurements apply to bulk cell membranes. Detectable changes in lipid composition do not occur shortly after fertilization.'

aS'We introduce two new, rapid procedures. One is specifically designed for isolating alpha-actinin from skeletal and the other for isolating alpha-actinin from smooth muscle. Approximately 20 mg of greater than 95% pure alpha-actinin can be obtained/100 g of ground chicken pectoral muscle in just 4 days. The smooth muscle protocol yields 2.7 mg of greater than 99% pure alpha-actinin/100 g of ground gizzard after just 5 days. Differences in protein contaminants and in the extractability of alpha-actinin necessitated the development of separate isolation procedures for the two muscle types. Antibody prepared against the purified gizzard alpha-actinin reacted with alpha-actinin from skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle in immunodiffusion. Anti-alpha-actinin reacted only with alpha-actinin from crude extracts of skeletal and smooth muscle on Staph A gels. Anti-alpha-actinin stained Z-bands from skeletal muscle in indirect immunofluorescence microscopy and stress fibers from baby hamster kidney fibroblasts and mouse mammary epithelial cells in the characteristic punctate pattern observed by other workers (Lazarides, E., and Burridge, K. (1975) Cell 6, 289-298). These two methods for purifying alpha-actinin from skeletal and smooth muscle represent a significant improvement over that published previously.'

aS'A serine esterase with potent proteolytic activity against native bovine lens capsule type IV collagen was isolated and purified from extract of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). The type IV collagenolytic activity co-purified with N-t-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-alanine nitroanilidase, and was inhibited by phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and N-acetyl-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala chloromethyl ketone. In addition, the purified enzyme had elastolytic activity, reacted with a specific antibody to PMN elastase, and, therefore, appeared to be identical with this enzyme. A simple, reproducible assay for the detection of type IV collagenase activity using insoluble bovine anterior lens capsule collagen was defined. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that the enzyme released large molecular weight peptides (greater than 30,000) from the insoluble substrate. The enzyme was also active against native, pepsin-solubilized type IV collagen; five reaction products could be identified. These data suggest that PMN elastase may be involved in the degradation of basement membrane collagen in physiologic and pathologic states.'

aS'Neurites were prepared by a novel method from differentiating mouse neuroblastoma cells. When electrically differentiated cells were labeled metabolically with L-[3H]fucose or D-[3H]glucosamine, both the neurites and the surface membranes showed the presence of a glycoprotein of apparent Mr = 200,000. In contrast, the level of this glycoprotein was reduced in the surface membranes from nondifferentiated cells and a radioactive glycoprotein of similar molecular weight was found in the growth medium. The method for the isolation of neurites is of potential usage in distinguishing specific proteins associated with growing neurites.'

aS'Immunoprecipitation of uniformly labeled yeast submitochondrial preparations using a subunit-specific or a holoenzyme antiserum has been employed to determine the subunit stoichiometry of the oligomycin-sensitive ATPase complex. The Triton-solubilized enzyme consists of 10 types of subunits. The number of copies of each subunit, in order of decreasing molecular weight, is 3:3:1:2:1:2:2:1:2:3. on the basis of the stoichiometry data, the ATPase complex has a molecular weight of 5.8 x 10(5) and contains a minimum of 20 polypeptide chains. Analysis of water-soluble ATPase (F1-ATPase) indicates that the stoichiometry of the three largest subunits of the enzyme is preserved in the absence of the other subunits. The molecular weights of both forms of the ATPase, derived from stoichiometry data, agree well with measurements obtained from gel filtration and sedimentation studies. The implications of these data for the structure, function, and assembly of the complex are discussed.'

aS'The uptake and metabolism of lymphatic large chylomicrons from fat-fed rats, lymphatic small chylomicrons from glucose-fed rats, and hepatic very low density lipoproteins from perfusates of isolated livers, and of remnants produced from these lipoproteins in functionally eviscerated rats were studied in the isolated perfused rat liver. All lipoproteins were labeled isotopically in their cholesteryl ester and triglyceride moieties. Uptake of the labeled lipids or large chylomicrons was slow and limited, but these lipids in small chylomicrons and hepatic very low density lipoproteins were taken up and metabolized progressively and at equal rates. Incubation with very low density lipoprotein-free plasma increased the content of C apolipoproteins in small chylomicrons and hepatic very low density lipoproteins and greatly retarded the hepatic uptake of their labeled lipids. In remnants from all sources, which are depleted of C apolipoproteins but not of apolipoprotein E, the labeled lipids were rapidly taken up and metabolized. Neither extensive hydrolysis of core triglycerides nor the production of monoglycerides was required for this rapid hepatic uptake. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that one or more of the C apolipoproteins opposes and apolipoprotein E promotes recognition of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins by a hepatic receptor.'

aS'Glutamine synthetase specific activity increases greater than 100-fold during the insulin-mediated differentiation of confluent 3T3-L1 cells into adipocytes. Incubation of the adipocytes for 22 h with 0.5 mM dibutyryl cyclic AMP plus 0.5 mM theophylline, 0.2 mM 8-bromo-cyclic AMP, 10 micro M epinephrine, or 1 microgram of alpha 1-24 adrenocorticotropic hormone/ml decreased glutamine synthetase by greater than 60%. During the same incubation period, there was no effect of these compounds on protein or on the specific activities of glucose-6-P dehydrogenase or hexokinase. In the presence of 0.5 mM theophylline, the dibutyryl cyclic AMP-mediated decrease in glutamine synthetase activity was half-maximal at 50 micro M dibutyryl cyclic AMP. Furthermore, between 10 micro M and 5 mM dibutyryl cyclic AMP, the dibutyryl cyclic AMP-mediated decrease in glutamine synthetase was similar in the absence or presence of 1 microgram of insulin/ml. Immunotitration of glutamine synthetase activity from 3T3 adipocytes indicates that the dibutyryl cyclic AMP-mediated decrease in the activity is due to a decrease in the cellular content of glutamine synthetase molecules. We studied the effects of dibutyryl cyclic AMP on the synthesis and degradation of glutamine synthetase. Synthesis rate was estimated from the incorporation of L-[35S]methionine into glutamine synthetase during a 60-min incubation period. Degradation rate was estimated from the first order disappearance of radioactivity from glutamine synthetase in 3T3 adipocytes previously incubated with L-[35S]methionine. Glutamine synthetase was isolated by immunoprecipitation followed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Incubation of 3T3 adipocytes with dibutyrl cyclic AMP resulted in a rapid decline in the apparent synthesis rate of glutamine synthetase. In addition, dibutyryl cyclic AMP treatment increased the initial rate of glutamine synthetase degradation. The half-life of glutamine synthetase was 24.5 h in control cultures and 16 h in dibutyryl cyclic AMP-treated cultures. In contrast, dibutyryl cyclic AMP had little effect on the synthesis or degradation of soluble protein. Our data indicate that the dibutyryl cyclic AMP-mediated decrease in 3T3 adipocyte glutamine synthetase activity results from a decrease in the synthesis rate and an increase in the initial degradation rate of the enzyme.'

aS'An icosadeoxyribonucleotide containing the several features found in prokaryotic mRNA ribosome binding sites has been synthesized. This sequence can stimulate the binding of initiator fMet-tRNAf to the ribosome to form a stable 71 S initiation complex identical with those induced by natural messengers. The binding of this synthetic ribosome binding site is absolutely dependent upon initiation factor IF3, and the bound fMet-tRNAf is sensitive to puromycin indicating the formation of a functional initiation complex. A heptadecadeoxyribonucleotide, identical with the icosanucleotide but lacking the terminal A-T-G codon, can also stimulate the stable binding of fMet-tRNAf to the ribosome, suggesting that the selection of the proper A-U-G initiation codon by fMet-tRNAf is subsequent to and a result of the recognition and binding of the fMet-tRNAf . 30 S ribosome complex to the initiation site. The prospect of ligating a similar synthetic ribosome binding site in front of a eukaryotic gene for cloning in an appropriate prokaryotic vector to assure the expresion of the protein is discussed.'

aS"pppA(2'p5'A)n-1 ((2'-5')(A)n) synthetase is one of the mediators of interferon action. On activation by double-stranded RNA, it converts ATP into (2'-5')(A)n; in turn, (2'-5')(A)n activates an endonuclease (RNase L) which cleaves single-stranded RNA. We report a simple procedure for the isolation of pure (2'-5')(A)n synthetase from interferon-treated Ehrlich ascites tumor cells. The procedure involves differential precipitation of the ribosomal salt wash fraction with ammonium sulfate and chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and CM-cellulose. The apparent molecular weight of the enzyme is 105,000 as determined by gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate and about 85,000 when determined by centrifugation through a glycerol gradient. The size range of the (2'-5')(A)n produced by the enzyme extends from the dimer to at least the pentadecamer."

aS'Stopped flow kinetic studies have been used to demonstrate three features of the enzymatic mechanism of the microsomal FAD-containing monooxygenase from hog liver. First, in contrast to the bacterial flavin-containing monooxygenases, reduction of the FAD is independent of substrate. Second, the rate of the reaction of reduced enzyme with oxygen to form the C(4a)-peroxyflavin intermediate is independent of substrate. Third, the rate of transformation of the C(4a)-peroxyflavin to oxidized FAD is substrate-dependent. These results are in agreement with the mechanism, determined by steady state kinetic studies (Poulsen, L.L., and Ziegler, D.M. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 6449-6455), which predicts that the reduced flavin reacts with oxygen before combination with substrate.'

aS'Alkaline-sensitive strains of Escherichia coli were selected by mutagenesis followed by penicillin killing in medium at pH 8.3. One such strain was found to lack K+/H+ exchange. At neutral pH, the doubling time of the mutant was not significantly different from that of the parent, but at pH 8.3 the doubling time of the mutant increased over 5-fold. No energy-dependent uptake of 204Tl+ was observed in the mutant, but addition of the K+/H+ exchanger Nigericin resulted in identical 204Tl+ uptake in the mutant and parent. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the K+/H+ antiporter is responsible for regulation of cytosolic pH in E. coli. In the absence of antiporter, the organism would be unable to grow at alkaline pH due to alkalinization of the cytosol.'

aS'5-Dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl (dansyl)-Co-eIF-2A was prepared using homogeneous Co-eIF-2A. Dansyl-Co-eIF-2A was as active as untreated Co-eIF-2A when assayed for stimulation of ternary complex formation and also for protection of the ternary complex from dissociation by aurintricarboxylic acid. The mechanism of interaction of dansyl-Co-eIF-2A with eIF-2 was studied by measuring changes in fluorescence polarization. These studies indicate that dansyl-Co-eIF-2A interacts specifically with the ternary complex and does not interact with free eIF-2 or with two other high molecular weight protein complexes, Co-eIF-2B and Co-eIF-2C. Mg2+ inhibits ternary complex formation by eIF-2 and Co-eIF-2C relieves this Mg2+ inhibition of ternary complex formation. In both cases, the changes in fluorescence polarization of dansyl-Co-eIF-2A correlate well with the extent of ternary complex formed.'

aS'Removal of the terminal sialic acid residues from most mammalian glycoproteins results in their rapid transfer from the circulation into the liver. In vitro, these desialylated glycoproteins bind to a specific membrane-associated hepatic lectin which has a ubiquitous distribution within the liver cell. In the present study, infusion of a specific antibody to the purified lectin into the portal vein of an isolated perfused rat liver prior to injection of radiolabeled asialoorosomucoid or bilirubin reduced the rate of influx of asialoorosomucoid into the liver by over 80%, while the influx of bilirubin was unchanged. Although uptake of asialoorosomucoid remained blocked for at least 90 min after excess antibody was removed from the perfusion system, the total hepatic content of functional binding protein was nearly normal. These results indicate that interaction with specific cell surface lectin is essential for removal of asialoorosomucoid from the circulation. During the 90 min following infusion of antibody, no functional lectin is restored to the surface of hepatocytes.'

aS'Monovalent Fab fragments from immunoglobulins, directed against Escherichia coli small ribosomal subunit proteins, were tested for their effect on poly(U)-directed synthesis of polyphenylalanine by rat liver ribosomes. Of the 18 Fabs tested, 3, anti-S10, anti-S12, and anti-S14, inhibited polyphenylalanine synthesis; antibodies against 3 of the 21 E. coli ribosomal proteins (S1, S16, and S17) were not tested. The others were either without any appreciable effect or, as in the case of anti-S11 and anti-S18, inhibited far less. Antibodies against S12 and S14 (but not against S10) inhibited elongation factor 1-dependent binding of [14C]Phe-tRNA to rat liver 80 S ribosomes. The presumption is that the prokaryotic (E. coli) ribosomal proteins, S10, S12, and S14, possess antigenic determinants also present in eukaryotic (rat liver) ribosomal proteins; the rat liver proteins have not yet been identified.'

aS"In Escherichia coli, amino acid starvation triggers the rapid synthesis of two guanosine polyphosphates, pppGpp and ppGpp (the 3'-pyrophosphates of GTP and GDP, respectively). Determination of the turnover rate of the ppGpp pool indicated that during serine deprivation, as opposed to other amino acid starvations, the rate of ppGpp degradation is dramatically decreased. This results in a slow but significant accumulation of this regulatory nucleotide in a relA mutant during serine starvation. Similar ppGpp accumulation can be seen during serine starvation in different serine auxotrophic mutants carrying different relA alleles. On the other hand, no ppGpp accumulation is induced in various relaxed strains by serine hydroxamate treatment."

aS'The carbon monoxide binding kinetics of the isolated trout Hb I has been investigated by flash photolysis at various temperatures, from approximately 20 degrees to 72 degrees C. The time course of recombination has been quantitatively analyzed with a simple two-state allosteric model, making use of the thermodynamic data previously obtained. These new experiments and their analysis show that a simple two-state kinetic model is adequate, in the case of trout Hb I, to describe quantitatively the time course of CO binding at all temperatures. Moreover, we show that temperature can be used to perturb the quaternary conformational equilibrium, the high affinity state of the molecule (R) being progressively more populated at higher temperatures.'

aS'The activities of the mitochondrial NAD(P)+- and NADP+-dependent malic enzymes were measured in 11 tissues of the male Sprague-Dawley rat. The NAD(P)+-dependent malic enzyme was present in small intestinal mucosa, spleen, thymus, lung, and testis. Each of these tissues contain cells that are undergoing active rates of renewal. The NADP+-dependent malic enzyme was not confined to tissues undergoing cell renewal, and was present in mitochondria from brain, skeletal, and heart muscle, kidney, and lung and testis. Both enzymes were absent or at a low activity in normal and regenerating liver. The results support, and extent to nonneoplastic tissues, our proposal that cells which show active and sustained rates of renewal contain the NAD(P)+-dependent malic enzyme and have a unique intramitochondrial pathway for malate oxidation (Sauer, L.A., Dauchy, R.T., Nagel, W.O., and Morris, H.P.

S. maxima cytochrome f has a molecular weight approximately 38,000 and is monomeric, while the spinach protein is slightly smaller, approximately 36,000 daltons, and aggregates to form an octamer. S. maxima cytochrome f has an E'0 of +339 mV which is close to that of cytochromes f from higher plants. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequences of the cytochromes show striking similarities. Spinach cytochrome f shows a clear preference for oxidation by spinach plastocyanin and S. maxima cytochrome f is more readily oxidized by its in vivo reaction partner, cytochrome c553."

aS'The thermal and guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) denaturation of lysozyme has been investigated at various concentrations of tri-N-acetylglucosamine ((GlcNAc)3), a trisaccharide which binds specifically at the active site of native lysozyme. The presence of (GlcNAc)3 leads to a readily observable stabilization of the protein to thermal and GdnHCl denaturation. An analysis of guanidine hydrochloride denaturation curves shows that the stability of lysozyme is increased by 495 cal/mol by the presence of 3 x 10(-4) M (GlcNAc)3. The midpoint of the thermal denaturation curve, T 1/2, is increased 1.6 and 5.3 degrees C by 2.02 x 10(-4) M and 1.38 x 10(-3) M (GlcNAc)3, respectively. This corresponds to an increase in the stability of lysozyme of 385 and 1275 cal/mol. These results are in excellent agreement with predictions based on an equation derived by Schellman ((1975) Biopolymers 14, 999-1018) to take into account the effect of ligand binding on the melting temperature of a protein. delta T 1/2 = TT0R divided by delta HD ln (1 + KB[S]) where T and T0 are T1/2 values in the presence and absence of (GlcNAc)3, delta HD is the enthalpy of denaturation in the presence of (GlcNAc)3, KB in the equilibrium constant for the binding of (GlcNAc)3 to lysozyme, and [S] is the free concentration of (GlcNAc)3. Thus, the increased stability of an enzyme in the presence of its substrate, coenzyme, or any small molecule that it binds specifically results because binding to the native state shifts the unfolding equilibrium and decreases the concentration of unfolded states of the enzyme. It is suggested that this may be a more important factor than substrate-induced conformational changes in acccounting for the decreased rates of protein catabolism frequently observed in vivo at elevated substrate concentrations.'

aS'The cholinergic mouse neuroblastoma cell line NS20Y was adapted to undifferentiated growth in suspension culture. When suspension cells were transferred to surface culture and treated with dibutyryl cyclic AMP, the cells underwent differentiation as assessed by biochemical, morphological, and physiological criteria. Differentiated NS20Y cells in co-culture with mouse muscle cells had the capacity to form functional neuromuscular junctions with the muscle cells. The sequence complexities of the poly(A)-containing messenger RNA (poly(A)+ mRNA) of the differentiated, process-forming cells (P-cells) and undifferentiated cells in suspension culture (S-cells) were measured by analysis of the kinetics of hybridization of the mRNAs with their complementary DNAs (cDNAs). There were less than 100 high abundance and approximately 8000 low abundance poly(A)+ mRNAs in both differentiation states. Heterologous hybridization reactions and recycling of the cDNA probes revealed that 9.7% and 6.8% of the messages in P- and S-cells, respectively, were specific to those differentiation states. The P-cell-specific sequences included approximately 3 high abundance and 320 low abundance poly(A)+ mRNAs. The S-cell-specific sequences included approximately 3 high abundance and 250 low abundance poly(A)+ mRNAs. We conclude that the increment in NS20Y differentiation results in both the disappearance of old, and the appearance of new mRNAs in polyribosomes.'

aS'Heparosan N-sulfate D-glucuronosyl 5-epimerase, which catalyzes the conversion of beta-D-glucuronosyl to alpha-L-iduronosyl residues in the course of heparin biosynthesis, has been purified approximately 9000-fold from the high speed supernatant fraction of a homogenate of a mouse mastocytoma. Following ammonium sulfate fractionation, the material precipitating between 35 and 60% saturation was subjected to a series of affinity chromatography steps on matrices containing immobilized concanavalin A, heparan sulfate, O-desulfated heparin, and Cibacron blue, respectively. Epimerase purified by this procedure yielded two major components on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified enzyme had approximately the same Kav as bovine serum albumin when chromatographed on Sepharose 6B. The activity of the purified enzyme was increased 50-fold by addition of the fraction which was not adsorbed to concanavalin A-Sepharose. The stimulating factor is likely to be a protein since it was nondialyzable, heat labile, and lost activity on digestion with trypsin.'

aS'The association rate constants for the interaction of alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor, oxidized alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor, and alpha-1-antichymotrypsin with several mammalian serine proteinases have been determined. The results indicate that leukocyte elastase reacts more rapidly with alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor than any other proteinase tested, while leukocyte cathepsin G shows the strongest association with alpha-1-antichymotrypsin. Oxidation of the critical methionine residue of alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor reduces the association with leukocyte elastase by a factor of more than 2000 and also lowers the association with all of the other enzymes tested with the exception of chymotrypsin. Significantly, oxidation completely abolishes any interaction of alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor with porcine elastase, human plasmin or human thrombin. These data support previous results (Johnson, D., and Travis, J. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 4022-4026) which indicated that oxidation of human alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor in vivo could reduce the effectiveness of this inhibitor in controlling proteolysis. In the lung, in particular, oxidizing agents of both chemical and biological sources could, indirectly, augment elastolysis in this tissue, resulting in the development of pulmonary emphysema.'

aS"Creatine kinase does not catalyze the scrambling of 18O in adenosine 5'-[alpha beta-18O, beta-18O2]triphosphate in the absence of creatine, in the presence of L-arginine or taurocyamine (competitive inhibitors of creatine), or in the presence of poor substrates where single turnover experiments were performed. In order to support this prima facie evidence for an associative mechanism of phosphoryl transfer, an investigation was undertaken of 1-carboxymethyl-2-aminoimidazole, a new substrate analogue of creatine. This analogue has a binding constant for rabbit muscle creatine kinase similar to creatine and 1-carboxymethyl-2-iminoimidazolidine, but the initial rate of phoshorylation by MgATP in the presence of creatine kinase is almost 5 orders of magnitude slower. The phosphorylation product, assigned the structure 1-carboxymethyl-2-imino-3-phospho-4-imidazoline is also a poor substrate for the phosphorylation of MgADP by creatine kinase. These observations can be accounted for by an associative SN2(P) mechanism of phosphoryl transfer and by a microenvironment of the enzyme-bound creatine (or creatine analogue) which lowers the pKa of the guanidino group by several pH units compared with that in aqueous solution."

aS'Human plasm contains at least two distinct kininogens, designated high Mr and low Mr kininogens, that differ in their Mr and susceptibility to different kallikreins. By limited proteolysis, plasma kallikrein cleaves high Mr kininogen to liberate kinin and gives a molecule containing two disulfide-linked polypeptide chains. Following reduction and alkylation of the two-chain molecule, the heavy chain and the light chain were isolated, and antisera were raised in goats against the alkylated heavy and light chains. The anti-heavy chain antiserum immunoprecipitated both high Mr and low Mr kininogen, whereas the anti-light chain antiserum was specific for high Mr kininogen. Thus, the heavy chain of kinin-free high Mr kininogen and low Mr kininogen extensively share identical immunologic determinants. In contrast, the immunologic determinants of the isolated light chain are unique to high Mr kininogen. Using immunochemical techniques, it was shown that high Mr kininogen or the light chain derived from it forms a complex either with prekallikrein or with kallikrein. Titrations of prekallikrein or kallikrein with increasing amounts of either high Mr kininogen or its alkylated light chain indicated that the complexes contain equimolar amounts of each molecule. These results show that a single site for prekallikrein or kallikrein binding to high Mr kininogen resides in the light chain region of the molecule.'

aS"Choleragen-dependent ADP ribosylation of soluble proteins from bovine thymus, using [32P]NAD as substrate, was increased 3- to 4-fold by GTP. The effect was specific for nucleoside triphosphate, with GTP approximately equal to ITP greater than CTP greater than ATP greater than UTP. Half-maximal enhancement was observed with 0.5 mM GTP. The magnitude of the GTP effect decreased with increasing NAD concentration; GTP had no effect on hydrolysis of NAD at low NAD concentrations. Digestion of ADP-ribosylated proteins with snake venom phosphodiesterase yielded primarily 5'-AMP. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of soluble proteins from thymus after incubation with choleragen and [32P]NAD separated numerous ADP-ribosylated proteins; radioactivity in all bands was increased by nucleoside triphosphate. Choleragen catalyzed the ADP ribosylation of several purified proteins; depending on the protein, GTP either increased, decreased, or had no effect on the extent of ADP ribosylation. Choleragen-dependent ADP ribosylation of a wide variety of proteins is consistent with the possibility that intoxication results in covalent modification of more than one cellular protein and perhaps alters the activity of other enzymes in addition to adenylate cyclase."

aS'It has been proposed that penicillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics are substrate analogs which inactivate certain essential enzymes of bacterial cell wall biosynthesis by acylating a catalytic site amino acid residue (Tipper, D.J., and Strominger, J.L. (1965) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 54, 1133-1141). A key prediction of this hypothesis, that the penicilloyl moiety and an acyl moiety derived from substrate both bind to the same active site residue, has been examined. D-Alanine carboxypeptidase, a penicillin-sensitive membrane enzyme, was purified from Bacillus subtilis and labeled covalently at the antibiotic binding site with [14C]penicillin G or with the cephalosporin [14C]cefoxitin. Alternatively, an acyl moiety derived from the depsipeptide substrate [14C]diacetyl L-Lys-D-Ala-D-lactate was trapped at the catalytic site in near-stoichiometric amounts by rapid denaturation of an acyl-enzyme intermediate. Radiolabeled peptides were purified from a pepsin digest of each of the 14C-labeled D-alanine carboxypeptidases and their amino acid sequences determined. Antibiotic- and substrate-labeled peptic peptides had the same sequence: Tyr-Ser-Lys-Asn-Ala-Asp-Lys-Arg-Leu-Pro-Ile-Ala-Ser-Met. Acyl moieties derived from antibiotic and from substrate were shown to be bound covalently in ester linkage to the identical amino acid residue, a serine at the penultimate position of the peptic peptide. These studies establish that beta-lactam antibiotics are indeed active site-directed acylating agents. Additional amino acid sequence data were obtained by isolating and sequencing [14C]penicilloyl peptides after digestion of [14C]penicilloyl D-alanine carboxypeptidase with either trypsin or cyanogen bromide and by NH2-terminal sequencing of the uncleaved protein. The sequence of the NH2-terminal 64 amino acids was thus determined and the active site serine then identified as residue 36. A computer search for homologous proteins indicated significant sequence homology between the active site of D-alanine carboxypeptidase and the NH2-terminal portion of beta-lactamases. Maximum homology was obtained when the active site serine of D-alanine carboxypeptidase was aligned correctly with a serine likely to be involved in beta-lactamase catalysis. These findings provide strong evidence that penicillin-sensitive D-alanine carboxypeptidases and penicillin-inactivating beta-lactamases are related evolutionarily.'

aS'Penicillin kills susceptible bacteria by specifically inhibiting the transpeptidase that catalyzes the final step in cell wall biosynthesis, the cross-linking of peptidoglycan. It was hypothesized (Tipper, D., and Strominger, J. (1965) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 54, 1133-1141) that 1) penicillin is a structural analog of the acyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine terminus of the pentapeptide side chains of nascent peptidoglycan, and that 2) penicillin, by virtue of its highly reactive beta-lactam structure, irreversibly acylates the active site of the cell wall transpeptidase. Although the cell wall transpeptidase has proven elusive, a closely related penicillin-sensitive cell wall enzyme, D-alanine carboxypeptidase, has been purified from membranes of Bacillus stearothermophilus by penicillin affinity chromatography. By amino acid sequence analysis of 14C-labeled cyanogen bromide peptides generated and purified from this carboxypeptidase covalently labeled with either [14C]penicillin G or the substrate, [14C]diacetyl-L-lysyl-D-alanyl-D-lactate, it was shown that the penicillin and substrate were both bound as esters to a serine at residue 36. Therefore, the second hypothesis stated above was proven to be correct for D-alanine carboxypeptidase. Several new methods were developed in the course of this work, including 1) a rapid penicillin-binding assay, 2) use of hydroxylamine to protect peptides against carbamylation during ion exchange chromatography in concentrated urea solutions, and 3) gel filtration chromatography in 70% formic acid, a universal solvent for peptides.'

aS'We have investigated the covalent binding of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) to cytochrome c oxidase in relation to its inhibition of ferrocytochrome c-induced H+ translocation by the enzyme reconstituted in lipid vesicles. DCCD bound to the reconstituted oxidase in a time- and concentration-dependent manner which appeared to correlate with its inhibition of H+ translocation. In both reconstituted vesicles and intact beef heart mitochondria, the DCCD-binding site was located in subunit III of the oxidase. The apolar nature of DCCD and relatively minor effects of the hydrophilic carbodiimide, 1-ethyl-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide, on H+ translocation by the oxidase indicate that the site of action of DCCD is hydrophobic. DCCD also bound to isolated cytochrome c oxidase, though in this case subunits III and IV were labeled. The maximal overall stoichiometries of DCCD molecules bound per cytochrome c oxidase molecule were 1 and 1.6 for the reconstituted and isolated enzymes, respectively. These findings point to subunit III of cytochrome c oxidase having an important role in H+ translocation by the enzyme and indicate that DCCD may prove a useful tool in elucidating the mechanism of H+ pumping.'

aS'Saturation analysis of equilibrium binding of iodinated thyrotropin (125I-TSH) to normal human thyroid preparations yielded linear Scatchard plots under non-physiological conditions of pH 6.0 or 20 mM Tris/acetate buffer, pH 7.4. The apparent equilibrium dissociation constant of this binding was approximately 10(-8) M. By contrast, nonlinear plots were obtained under standard conditions of pH 7.4 and 40 mM Tris/acetate buffer. Resolution of the components of these curves by computer analysis revealed the presence of at least two classes of binding sites, one of which is of a low capacity and high affinity (approximately 10(-10) M) consistent with receptor binding. The other component is of a high capacity and lower affinity. Binding to non-target tissues of muscle, parathyroid, mammary carcinoma, and placenta was only demonstrable at pH 6.0 or in 20 mM Tris/acetate buffer, pH 7.4, yielding linear Scatchard plots with similar binding affinity (approximately 10(-8)M) to normal thyroid but much reduced capacity. Preincubation of thyroid tissue at 50 degrees C resulted in an apparent selective loss of the high affinity component of binding measured under standard conditions. Kinetic experiments on the dissociation of bound 125I-TSH were undertaken to determine whether the non-linearity of Scatchard plots was due to two or more classes of binding sites or negative cooperativity. It was found that the experimental determinant that is presently ascribed to a negative cooperativity phenomenon regulating receptor affinity (i.e. an enhanced dilution-induced dissociation rate in the presence of excess native hormone), although apparently hormone-specific, was demonstrated under nonphysiological binding conditions and in non-target tissue. Significantly, the phenomenon was found under conditions of pH 6.0 or 20 mM Tris where a linear Scatchard plot was obtained. The evidence thus suggests that 125I-TSH binds to heterogeneous binding sites (of which the high affinity is probably the receptor for TSH) and that the enhanced dilution-induced dissociation of bound hormone by native hormone for this system, is only a characteristic of the low affinity binding site (maybe gangliosides).'

aS'In the rat hepatocyte, whether freshly separated or in primary culture, we do not find L-glutamine entry by Systems A and ASC as seen in cells previously studied. Instead the mediated entry of glutamine appears to occur exclusively by a Na+-dependent system ("N") apparently specific to amino acid amides and L-histidine; however, a portion of asparagine uptake occurs by System A. The simplest evidence for the separateness of the added system is the failure of model substrates for System A (e.g. N-methylalanine) to inhibit glutamine uptake significantly, and the failure of glutamine to inhibit the uptake of L-cysteine, model substrate for System ASC, at least in this cell. As is the case for cysteine, glutamine inhibits transport by System A (although not competitively), even though showing no transport by that system. Our finding confirms an earlier inference that glutamine uptake by this cell may follow a route not taken by alanine or serine, and explains the apparently erroneous companion inference that glutamine also shares a route with these two amino acids. Its uptake has now been characterized to show a series of differences from Systems A and ASC. Especially significant in view of the importance of glutamine metabolism are an insensitivity of the new system to stimulation by either insulin or glucagon, and its distinct enhancement (not as large as that for System A) on starvation of the cells with respect to amino acids. Hence, a second system has been found to show adaptive regulation.'

aS'The first quantitative measurements of the effect of metal substitution on (myo)globin conformational stability are reported. Metallomyoglobins examined include Fe(III), Cr(III), Rh(III), Mn(III), Fe(II), Zn(II), Cu(II), and Ru(II). It is shown that the protein denaturant interaction is not altered, in general, by metal substitution. Therefore reversible denaturation provides a means to assess the dependence of myoglobin conformational energy on metal electronic state. A simple relationship was found between the conformational free energy of trivalent metal derivatives (delta delta G0u) and the metal imidazole bond strength (delta Gim) of that derivative. Clear differences are observed between the divalent and trivalent metal derivatives, independent of delta Gim.'

aS'Kinetic studies on the unfolding of pepsinogen by urea showed that changes in absorbance and potential pepsin activity followed simple first order kinetics. Changes in these variables on refolding were more complex. A large part of the absorbance was recovered within the mixing time of these experiments, whereas the appearance of activity was a slow sigmoidal function of time. The results were interpreted to show that pepsinogen can rapidly regain a globular form, but that its activatable form is produced by a slow conformational change in the folded protein. The enthalpies of activation of this change are similar to those of the cis-trans isomerization of proline residues. If the latter reaction is involved in the folding of pepsinogen, it must occur after extensive folding has already occurred.'

aS'Cyanogen bromide fragments of alpha 1-protease inhibitor (PI) were chromatographed on Sephadex G-75. Three fragments (CNBr-I, -II, and -III) contained carbohydrates with nearly the same composition, i.e. Man3, Gal2-3, (GlcNAc)4-5, and (NeuAc)2-3. These three fragments were digested with pronase, and the glycopeptides were purified by column chromatography on Sephadex G-50, Bio-Gel P-4, and DEAE-cellulose. The carbohydrate and amino acid compositions of the glycopeptides obtained by these treatments demonstrated that oligosaccharide side chains are attached to three asparaginyl residues which are located in separate regions of the polypeptide chain, and that the carbohydrate chains are made of two different carbohydrate compositions. The A-chain consists of Man3, Gal2, (GlcNAc)4, and (NeuAc)2, and the B-chain consists of Man3, Gal3, (GlcNAc)5, and (NeuAc)3. CNBr-III contained only A-type oligosaccharide while CNBr-II contained both A-type and B-type oligosaccharides in a ratio of about 2:1. CNBr-I, derived from the NH2 terminus of PI, contained mainly A-type, but also some B-type oligosaccharide.'

aS'Human alpha 1-protease inhibitor has three oligosaccharide side chains attached to 3 separate asparaginyl residues of the protein by N-glycosyl linkages. Two of the three asparaginyl residues link mostly to the A-type oligosaccharide chains which consist of Man3, Gal2, (GlcNAc)4 and (NeuAc)2. One of the three asparaginyl residues also attaches to a B-type oligosaccharide chain, which consists of Man3, Gal3, (GlcNAc)5, and (NeuAc)3. The ratio of A-chain to B-chain in this particular position is about 2:1. The structures of A- and B-chains of the glycoprotein were examined by periodate oxidation, sequential glycosidase digestion, and permethylation. The results unequivocally revealed the following structure for A-chains. (Formula: see text). B-type oligosaccharide chains have an additional trisaccharide, i.e. NeuAc 2 alpha leads to 3 Gal 1 beta leads to 4 GlcNAc attached to mannose at the (a) and/or (b) position of A-type chains by a beta 1 leads to 4 linkage. The sialic acid of human alpha 1-protease inhibitor was determined to be N-acetylneuraminic acid.'

aS"Previous observations suggested that pyridoxal 5'-phosphate was capable of inhibiting estrogen . receptor (R . E2) activation, or translocation to the nucleus, or both. The present study attempts to define more specifically the locus of this action. To this end we have examined the physicochemical alteration produced by interaction of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate with estrogen . receptor complex, using sucrose density gradient analysis and dissociation kinetics. Receptor transformation was inhibited when activation was performed in the presence of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. This effect was protein- and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate concentration-dependent. When pyridoxal 5'-phosphate was introduced postactivation it did not have any effect on the activated receptor, but when similar treatment was followed by NABH4 reduction, the complex reverted to the monomeric entity. The dissociation behavior obtained with cytosol R . E2, warmed in the presence of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, showed a biphasic curve suggesting that a significant portion of receptors remained nonactivated as demonstrated by the fast dissociating component. Due to the fact that Tris buffers cannot be used for pyridoxal 5'-phosphate experiments, we have used a borate buffer which resulted in a displacement of the sedimentation values from a 4S to 4.6 S for the unactivated receptor and 5S to 6 S for the activated form. The observations reported suggest that at least the initial effect of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate results in the inhibition of cytosolic receptor transformation from the nonactivated to the activated form."

aS'Cytosol prepared from homogenates of bone from vitamin D3-deficient chicks contains a 3.7 S macromolecule having high affinity and low capacity for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Employing 1,25-dihydroxy-[26,27-3H]vitamin D3 (160 Ci/mmol) an apparent Kd has been calculated to be 7.6 x 10(-11) M while the association and dissociation rate constants for the binding process at 25 degrees C were determined to be 9.5 x 10(8) M-1 min-1 and 2.3 x 10(-2) min-1, respectively. A 5.5 S molecule is also present which binds 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 but appears to prefer 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and is increased by the addition of chick serum to cytosol. The 3.7 S material is neither a serum contaminant nor a component of the 5.5 S molecular species and is likely of intracellular origin. Under low salt conditions the 3.7 S macromolecule migrates to 4.3 S and 5.5 S regions on sucrose gradients suggesting aggregation of the protein. Several vitamin D3 metabolites are capable of specifically binding to the 3.7 S macromolecule. The relative order of potency for several analogs causing displacement of specifically bound 1,25-dihydroxy-[26,27-3H]vitamin D3 is: 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 greater than 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 greater than or equal to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 greater 24(R),25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. It is concluded that chick bone cytosol contains a macromolecule of high affinity and low capacity for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 which may function as a receptor for some physiological events in bone.'

aS'In previous studies in this laboratory, highly purified liver microsomal cytochrome P-450 was shown to catalyze the hydroperoxide-dependent hydroxylation of a variety of substrates in the absence of NADPH, NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase, and molecular oxygen, and evidence was obtained that the oxygen atom in the product was derived from the peroxide. To determine whether the cytochrome functions in such reactions by a peroxidase-type mechanism, the kinetics of its interactions with a variety of substituted hydroperoxides and peroxy acids have been determined by stopped flow spectrophotometry. The reaction of P-450LM2 with various peroxy compounds yields an intermediate with an absorption maximum at about 436 nm in the difference spectrum, with pseudo-first order or biphasic kinetics depending upon the individual rate constants and the concentration of the oxidant used. The results are in accord with a reversible two-step mechanism, as follows: P-450 + oxidant in equilibrium C in equilibrium D, where C represents a transient intermediate which is detected spectrally only under certain conditions and is probably an enzyme . oxidant complex, and D is the complex with an absorption maximum at about 436 nm in the difference spectrum. The absolute and difference spectra of C and D vary in magnitude and in the positions of maxima and minima with the organic moiety of the peroxy compound used. Whereas the kinetics of the reaction with cumene hydroperoxide and benzyl hydroperoxide is unchanged in the pH range 5.0 to 9.0, that of perbenzoic acids decreases markedly at higher pH, thus indicating that only the unionized compound reacts with the enzyme. Experiments with a variety of substituted cumene hydroperoxides, benzyl hydroperoxides, and perbenzoic acids indicated that the first equilibrium is driven to the right by hydrophobic bonding of the oxidant to P-450LM2 and that the rate of conversion of C to D is increased by electron-withdrawing substituents in the oxidant and decreased by electron donating substituents. Following the formation of Complex D, irreversible heme destruction occurs slowly. These results indicate that the reaction of liver microsomal P-450 with peroxides differs in two important respects from that of typical peroxidases; the intermediates arising from the reaction of P-450LM2 with peroxy compounds are formed reversibly, and the spectra of these intermediates vary with structural differences in the peroxy compounds. Furthermore, the absence of a common isosbestic point in the spectra observed with P-450LM2 rules out the possibility that they represent mixtures of Compounds I and II as reported for peroxidases.'

aS'Tryptophan hydroxylase (EC 1.14.16.4) from rat mid-brain is inactivated upon exposure to oxygen. The degree of inactivation is dependent both on the temperature and partial pressure of oxygen to which the enzyme is exposed. Furthermore, molecular oxygen, and not an oxygen or hydroxyl radical, is responsible for the inactivation. Sulfhydryl compounds and reductants partially protect the hydroxylase from inactivation by oxygen. Enzyme inhibited by oxygen can be reconstituted by anaerobic incubation in the presence of dithiothreitol and Fe2+ at 25 degrees C and in some experiments the inclusion of inorganic sulfide, in addition to dithiothreitol and Fe2+, led to even greater recoveries of activity. Preincubation of tryptophan hydroxylase with various sulfhydryl reagents or disulfide compounds also produces inactivation which can be rapidly reversed by dithiothreitol. The substrate tryptophan protects the enzyme from inactivation by sulfhydryl reagents and disulfides but not from inactivation by oxygen. Finally, the enzyme was inhibited by a variety of iron chelators. These results suggest that the catalytic activity of tryptophan hydroxylase is dependent on the oxidation-reduction status of--SH groups and iron sites, which are probably located at the catalytic (substrate binding) site of the enzyme.'

aS'The reactions of human hemoglobin with a series of 13 alkyl isocyanides have been examined in equilibrium titration experiments at pH 7, 20 degrees C. The ligands include: methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, (+)- and (-)-sec-butyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl, n-hexyl, cyclohexyl, and benzyl isocyanides. All of these compounds exhibit sigmoidal binding curves; however, the amount of cooperativity expressed decreases with ligand length and increases as the alkyl side chains become more highly substituted. The overall affinity of hemoglobin for these compounds also exhibits a complex dependence on ligand size and stereochemistry. These results have been interpreted in terms of competing favorable hydrophobic interactions and unfavorable protein steric effects. The overall chemical potentials of the bound ligands were calculated from the sum of the observed binding free energy change and the relative chemical potentials of the isonitriles in aqueous solution. The resulting values allowed the construction of a rough, three-dimensional free energy map of steric hindrance at the sixth coordination position of the heme iron atom. This scheme suggests a cylindrical cavity of weak protein interactions into which ethyl isocyanide can easily fit. This cavity or mobile region of protein structure is surrounding by a more rigid region which results in large unfavorable steric interactions. Finally, this ring of more rigid structure is followed by an outer area where considerably smaller steric hindrance effects are observed.'

aS'The reactions of 13 isonitriles with deoxyhemoglobin have been examined and characterized at pH 7, 20 degrees C. Kinetic studies have shown that these ligands can be divided into two mechanistic classes based on their size and stereochemistry. The larger and branched compounds (isopropyl, all butyl isomers, n-pentyl, n-hexyl, cyclohexyl, and benzyl isocyanides) exhibit biphasic time courses at all ligand concentrations as a result of intrinsic differences between the reactivities of the alpha and beta subunits. In contrast, the smaller isonitriles (methyl, ethyl, and n-propyl isocyanides) exhibit monophasic, and often accelerating, time courses at high ligand concentrations. At low concentrations, the smaller isonitriles also exhibit biphasic time courses; however, in this case, the two phases are due to marked differences between the dissociation rate constants of the high and low affinity quaternary conformations of the protein. Sets of equilibrium and kinetic data for the binding of 11 of the isonitriles were fitted to an expanded version of the two-state allosteric model first described by Monad, Wyman, and Changeux (Monod, J., Wyman, J., and Changeux, J.-P. (1965) J. Mol. 12, 108 118). The resultant rate and equilibrium constants for the R (high affinity) and T (low affinity) states were used to calculate chemical potentials for ligand molecules bound to the heme iron and for the kinetic barriers experienced by these compounds during the binding process. For the beta subunits, both the difference between the bound chemical potentials for the R and T states and the differences between the barrier potentials for the two protein conformations are independent of ligand length and stereochemistry. Thus, it would appear that steric interactions are not a major factor in the expression of cooperativity by these subunits. For alpha chains, a 30% decrease in the difference between the bound R and T state potentials is observed in going from methyl to n-hexyl isocyanide. In addition, a marked increase in the height of the T state, alpha chain kinetic barrier is observed with increasing length of the alkyl side chain. Thus, steric hindrance between the bound ligand molecule and protein residues at the sixth coordination position of the heme iron atom does appear to play a significant role in the expression of cooperativity by the alpha subunits, at least for the larger alkyl isocyanides.'

aS'An enzyme present in rabbit liver microsomes has been found to catalyze mannosyltransfer from GDP-mannose to exogenously added oligosaccharide-lipid acceptor resulting in the formation of an alpha-1,2-mannosyl-mannose linkage. Several lines of evidence suggest that the product is a heptasaccharide containing a single 1,6-linked branched glycosyl unit with 65% of the newly added mannosyl units in a terminal nonreducing position. The enzyme has been solubilized with non-ionic detergents and was partially purified on DEAE-cellulose and hydroxylapatite. The partially purified enzyme no longer catalyzed the formation of dolichol-P-mannose indicating a direct transfer from GDP-mannose to oligosaccharide-lipid acceptor.'

aS'Several fluorinated derivatives of p-hydroxybenzoate were synthesized and examined as substrates in the reaction catalyzed by p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase. All the derivatives tested served as substrates, undergoing tightly coupled hydroxylation by molecular oxygen. Hydroxylation of the difluoro and tetrafluoro derivatives liberated stoichiometric amounts of fluoride. Little or no fluoride was released with monofluoro substrates. The defluorination caused higher consumption of NADPH with an overall NADPH to oxygen ratio of 2, in contrast to the ratio of 1 with the physiological substrate and with the monofluoro derivatives. Evidence was obtained strongly suggestive of a quinonoid species as the primary product formed upon oxygenative defluorination. The additional equivalent of NADPH consumed upon fluoride elimination is presumably used in a nonenzymatic reaction with the quinonoid intermediate, resulting in the observed dihydroxy product. Stopped flow studies of the reductive and oxidative half-reactions with tetrafluoro-p hydroxybenzoate substrate were examined. The oxygen half-reaction was analogous to that with p-hydroxybenzoate involving two transient oxygenated flavin intermediates. The decay of the first intermediate, a C(4a)-peroxyflavin, results in rupture of the oxygen-oxygen bond and is rate-determining in overall catalysis. This is in contrast to the reaction with the normal substrate, presumably due to a deactivating effect of the fluorine substituents. The above results are consistent with an oxenoid mechanism of oxygen attack.'

aS'An eight-iron, eight-sulfur ferredoxin from Rhizobium japonicum bacteroids of soybean root nodules has been purified to apparent homogeneity as judged by disc gel electrophoresis. The purification procedure included chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, Bio-Gel P-60, and hydroxylapatite. Specific activities of several purified preparations of bacteroid ferredoxin ranged from 1700 to 1900 nmol of C2H4 produced . min-1 . mg-1 in the reaction mediating electron transfer between illuminated chloroplasts and bacteroid nitrogenase. A molecular weight of 6740 for the protein was determined by low speed sedimentation equilibrium and a molecular weight of 6500 was estimated from the mobility of bacteroid ferredoxin relative to the mobility of standard proteins during sodium dodecyl sulfate disc gel electrophoresis. All of the common amino acids were present except arginine, methionine, and tryptophan. The absorbance spectrum of the oxidized protein exhibited maxima at 285 nm and 380 nm with a shoulder near 305 nm. The A380/A285 ratio was 0.76 and the extinction coefficient at 380 nm for the oxidized protein was found to be 30,800 M-1. Equilibration of bacteroid ferredoxin with methyl viologen at various potentials revealed a midpoint oxidation-reduction potential of -484 mV. Spectrophotometric examination of iron-sulfur clusters extruded from bacteroid ferredoxin with benzenethiol and the transfer of its iron-sulfur clusters to other ferredoxins established the presence of two [4Fe-4S] clusters in a molecule of bacteroid ferredoxin. The EPR spectrum of oxidized ferredoxin consisted of a small signal at g = 2.02 integrating to 0.19 spin/molecule. The EPR spectrum of ferredoxin reduced with 5-deazaflavin exhibited a signal with features at g values of 1.88, 1.94, 2.01, and 2.07, and integrated to 1.7 spins/molecule. The EPR properties of bacteroid ferredoxin are characteristic of a ferredoxin operating between the 1+ and 2+ oxidation levels. Bacteroid ferredoxin mediated electron transfer to clostridial hydrogenase, but was not reduced by the clostridial phosphoroclastic system in the presence of pyruvate. Bacteroid ferredoxin reduced by illuminated 5-deazariboflavin also supported a high rate of C2H2 reduction by bacteroid nitrogenase which was free of Na2S2O4. It was concluded, on this basis, that bacteroid ferredoxin has the capability of functioning as the electron donor for nitrogenase in R. japonicum.'

aS'A dianionic spin label, 1-L-glutamate-5-N-(1-oxyl-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-aminopiperidinyl)-i,4-dinitrobenzene, has been used to probe the relative binding specificity of a single anionic ligand site on bovine alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) to arachidonate, bilirubin, docosahexaenoate, and plamitate. The binding isotherm of the spin label with AFP, as shown by a Scatchard plot, indicates the presence of a single high affinity binding site. The site-site relationship of the four endogenous ligands, arachidonate, bilirubin, docosahexaenoate, and palmitate, was determined by studying their effectiveness in competing for this anionic ligand binding site on AFP. Scatchard plots of the spin label in the presence of 1 to 3 molar equivalents of arachidonate, bilirubin, and docosahexaenoate and up to 6 molar equivalents of palmitate have been determined. The effectiveness of the four endogenous ligands in displacing the spin label from its primary binding site is bilirubin greater than or equal arachidonate approximately equal to docosahexaenoate greater than palmitate. These results indicate that polyunsaturated essential fatty acids and bilirubin share a high affinity binding site on AFP. We propose that the function of this anionic ligand binding site on AFP is for the transport of bilirubin and polyunsaturated fatty acids in fetal serum, as well as for the cross-placental transfer of this metabolite and of essential fatty acids.'

aS'Endogenous lactose-binding proteins from adult chicken liver and intestine have been purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography on asialofetuinderivatized Sepharose, followed by isoelectric focusing. Since these carbohydrate-binding proteins are assayed as hemagglutinins, they are referred to by the operational term lectins. Although the hemagglutination activity of these lectins is inhibited by similar concentrations of inhibitory saccharides, they are not the same. They differ in specific hemagglutination activity, subunit molecular weight, and isoelectric point. They have very different peptide maps and show no detectable immunological cross-reactivity. Based on gel filtration studies, the liver lectin behaves as a dimer with apparent Mr = 31,000 +/- 1100, whereas the intestinal lectin behaves as a monomer with apparent Mr = 14,000 +/- 1700. Although clearly different from the intestinal lectin, the lectin from adult liver appears identical with the lectin previously purified from embryonic skeletal muscle.'

aS'The specificity of the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase was examined using two series of dodecapeptides as substrates. One series consisted of peptides of the general sequence (Gly)x-Arg-Arg-(Gly)y-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly in which x + y = 6. The other series consisted of peptides of the sequence (Gly)x-Lys-Arg-(Gly)y-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly in which x + y was again equal to 6. The peptides Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Arg-Arg-Ser-Leu-Gly and Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Lys-Arg-Ser-Leu-Gly were also examined. In the series in which the adjacent arginines were located various distances from the serine, the substrate for which the enzyme clearly exhibited optimal kinetic constants contained one amino acid residue between the basic residues and serine. Direct binding studies of N alpha-[3H]acetyl peptides to catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase revealed a correlation between binding affinity and the ability to serve as substrate for the enzyme. In the second series in which the adjacent basic amino acids were Lys-Arg, optimal kinetic constants were again obtained when these residues were separated from serine by a single amino acid. This latter result was surprising in view of phosphorylation site sequences in the known physiologically significant protein substrates for the kinase, since those containing Lys-Arg all contain two amino acids between these residues and serine.'

aS'An incomplete precursor of lipid A produced by a mutant of Salmonella typhimurium conditionally defective in synthesis of 3-deoxy-D-mannooctulosonate (KDO) (Rick, P.D., and Osborn, M.J. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 4895-4903) is poorly translocated to the outer membranes. Approximately 40% of the lipid A precursor synthesized under nonpermissive conditions was recovered in the isolated inner (cytoplasmic) membrane fraction, and the rate of translocation to outer membrane in pulse-chase experiments was only 20% that of lipopolysaccharide. However, integration of the incomplete molecule into the outer membrane appeared to be similar to that of lipopolysaccharide in stability and irreversibility. The ultimate extent of translocation pulse-labeled precursor was comparable to that of lipopolysaccharide and the process was functionally unidirectional. Little or no reverse translocation from outer to inner membrane was detected during conversion of preformed lipid A precursor to lipopolysaccharide following return to permissive conditions.'

aS'The incomplete lipid A precursor produced by a mutant conditionally defective in synthesis of 3-deoxy-D-mannoctulosonate (KDO) is rapidly converted to lipopolysaccharide when the mutant culture is shifted from nonpermissive to permissive conditions (Osborn, M.J., Rick, P.D., and Rasmussen, N.S. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 4246-4251). An intermediate product which accumulates transiently during this conversion has been isolated and identified as a derivative of the lipid A precursor containing 2 residues of KDO. The intermediate lacks the saturated O-fatty acyl chains of the completed lipid A and is indistinguishable in composition and chromatographic properties from the previously described product obtained by enzymatic addition of KDO to isolated lipid A precursor (Munson, R.S., Jr., Rasmussen, N.S., and Osborn, M.J. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 1503-1511). The intermediate produced in vivo is rapidly converted to lipopolysaccharide under conditions in which its continued formation is interrupted by return of the culture to nonpermissive temperature. The results provide direct evidence that transfer of KDO to lipid A precedes addition of the saturated fatty acid residues.'

aS'The effect of cerulenin on conversion of an acyl-deficient precursor of lipid A to lipopolysaccharide was investigated in a mutant of Salmonella typhimurium (PRX22H9) conditionally defective in synthesis of 3-deoxy-D-mannooctulosonate (KDO). The precursor lacks both KDO and the saturated O-fatty acyl chains of lipopolysaccharide and contains beta-hydroxymyristate as sole fatty acid. Concentrations of cerulenin which inhibited de novo synthesis of fatty acids and lipopolysaccharide more than 95% had no effect on the rate or extent of conversion of preformed lipid A precursor to a lipopolysaccharide product. The product was identified as a polymer containing the Rc type core polysaccharide of PRX22H9 linked to the acyl-deficient lipid A unit of the precursor. The acyl-deficient lipopolysaccharide was translocated to the outer membrane at a normal rate. Lipopolysaccharide deficient in saturated fatty acids was also produced by a fabD mutant of Escherichia coli under conditions of limited endogenous fatty acid synthesis. The results indicate that prior incorporation of the saturated O-acyl chains of lipid A is not necessary for extension of the core polysaccharide chain and that synthesis of underacylated lipopolysaccharides occurs under conditions of restricted fatty acid synthesis which permit formation of the beta-hydroxymyristate-containing lipid A precursor.'

aS'The intrinsic isotope effect on the reduction of the FAD-containing dehydrogenase electron transferase, adrenodoxin reductase, by (4S)-[2H]NADPH has been determined to be 7.1 to 7.7. The replacement of FAD by a series of FAD analogs at the active site of adrenodoxin reductase with oxidation-reduction potentials which vary over a range of 212 mV has made it possible to extrapolate to this limiting value from the variation in the observed isotope effect on Vmax with flavin midpoint potential. Stop-flow studies which allow the direct determination of the intrinsic isotope effect on the reductive half-reaction corroborate this result. During the steady state reduction of ferricyanide by the native enzyme under conditions of Vmax, this isotope effect is almost fully expressed (VH/VD = 6.7 to 6.8). In contrast, we observe a dramatic attenuation of the intrinsic isotope effect (due to hydride transfer to flavin) when the oxidative half-reaction is mediated by the natural acceptor protein, the 2Fe/2S ferredoxin, adrenodoxin. In a coupled three-protein system, the adrenodoxin-mediated reductions of both the artificial electron acceptor, cytochrome c, and the physiological electron acceptor, cytochrome P-450scc, by adrenodoxin reductase occur at similar rates and with similar kinetic isotope effects (1.9 to 2.0) when (4S)-[2H]NADPH is the reductant. We infer similar mechanisms for the reduction of both cytochromes. These results are in agreement with previous studies (Lambeth, J.D., and Kamin, H. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 2766-2774) which show that the reductive half-reaction is not solely rate-determining in adrenodoxin-mediated processes. The observation of a linear free energy relationship between Vmax and the flavin midpoint potential during steady state reduction of ferricyanide confirms that the reductive half-reaction is rate-determining in this assay. The relationship between Vmax and flavin midpoint potential in reactions which require adrenodoxin suggests that the midpoint potential of native adrenodoxin reductase has been optimized. Thus, the apoenzyme of adrenodoxin reductase tailors the midpoint potential of bound FAD in order to balance the activation energies of the reductive and oxidative half-reactions.'

aS'Two human breast cancer cell lines (T-47D and MCF-7) and one cell line derived from normal human milk (HBL-100) not only specifically bound but also degraded prolactin. Quantitative differences in the ability to bind and degrade prolactin among the cell lines exist, although there was a good correlation between the number of prolactin receptor sites and prolactin degradative activity. Iodo-prolactin as well as native prolactin were degraded. The prolactin molecule was processed to yield at least three small molecular weight peptides which were released into the incubation medium. These peptides neither bound to fresh receptors nor to anti-prolactin antibodies. The protease inhibitor N-alpha-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone, lysosomotropic agents such as chloroquine and ammonium chloride, and metabolic inhibitors 2,4-dinitrophenol and sodium azide, all abolished prolactin degradation by the breast cancer cells. When prolactin degradation was inhibited, specific binding and the subsequent release of intact 125I-prolactin was still observable, suggesting that hormonal degradation was not a prerequisite to dissociation of prolactin. However, prolactin degradation did account for the accelerated rate of dissociation of prolactin. Studies utilizing inhibitors suggest that the receptor-bound 125I-prolactin was degraded by an energy-dependent internalization process such as pinocytosis; lysosomal enzymes are probably involved in the degradation of prolactin by human breast cancer cells.'

aS'A wide variety of double-stranded DNA templates are replicated extensively in an in vitro DNA replication system containing the purified proteins specified by seven T4 bacteriophage DNA replication genes (32, 41, 43, 44, 62, 45, and 61). In favorable conditions, this multiprotein system catalyzes the synthesis of several copies of the input DNA template in a 30- to 60-min incubation. The replication forks produced in vitro move in a highly processive fashion, at approximately the in vivo rate of 500 nucleotides per s. The DNA synthesized on the lagging side of the in vitro replication fork is made discontinuously, as it is in vivo, giving rise to "Okazaki pieces" averaging some 10,000 nucleotides in length; in contrast, DNA is polymerized in a continuous manner on the leading side of the in vitro fork. Although the mechanism by which the seven-protein in vitro DNA replication system propagates replication forks closely resembles the in vivo mechanism, it lacks the capacity to remove RNA primers, to reseal Okazaki pieces, and to initiate replication forks at defined DNA origins; supplementation of the system with additional T4-specific replication proteins will be required to facilitate these latter three functions.'

aS'Late in the life cycle of the single-stranded DNA phage phi X, the synthesis of positive strand DNA is coupled to the maturation of progeny virions. DNA synthesis and packaging take place in a replication-assembly complex, which we have purified to homogeneity and characterized. The following conclusions can be drawn: 1. The DNA component of the replication-assembly complex is a rolling circle with a single-stranded DNA tail which is less than or equal to genome length. 2. The major protein component of the replication-assembly complex is an intact viral capsid, as shown by gel analysis of 35S-labeled complexes. As replication proceeds at the DNA growing point, the positive strand tail of the rolling circle is displaced directly into the capsid. In addition to the capsid, the complex contains at least 1 molecule of the phi X gene A nicking protein, which appears to be covalently linked to the DNA. 3. The rolling circle . capsid complex can be purified to homogeneity by taking advantage of its uniform sedimentation velocity (35 S) and its uniform density upon equilibrium centrifugation in CsCl (1.50 g/cc). 4. The replication-assembly complex can be visualized in the electron microscope. An electron-dense particle, which has the dimensions of a viral capsid, is observed attached to a rolling circle at the DNA growing point. 5. Hybridization of specific phi X restriction fragments to the deproteinized, single-stranded tails of intact rolling circles has allowed the use of these replicating intermediates to determine both the origin/terminus and the direction of phi X positive strand DNA synthesis. The ends of the rolling circle tails map in the Hae III restriction Fragment Z6b, at the position on the phi X genome at which the gene A endonuclease is known to cut. This result indicates that this endonuclease participates in the "termination" of each round of synthesis by cutting off unit-length viral genomes. 6. Rolling circle . capsid complexes were also isolated from two other icosahedral, single-stranded DNA phages: G4 and St-1. The rolling circle . capsid complex seen in the case of the single-stranded DNA phages represents the first example of a structure in which DNA synthesis and viral assembly occur in a coupled manner. This tight coordination explains why double-stranded DNA circles are the net product of synthesis early in the viral life cycle while only single-stranded DNA circles are produced later. The single-stranded tails of the rolling circle intermediates are available for conversion to the duplex state at early times, whereas the concentration of preformed capsids later is high enough to bind to all of the replicating molecules and package the emerging positive strand DNA.'

aS'A DNA-dependent RNA polymerase has been purified to homogeneity from bacteriophage N4 virions. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-8 M urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the enzyme revealed a single polypeptide with a molecular weight of 350,000. The hydrodynamic properties of the enzyme have been determined to be 9.5 S for the sedimentation coefficient and 84 A for the Stokes radius. These two parameters indicate a native molecular weight of 320,000. Enzyme activity is dependent on the presence of Mg2+, the four ribonucleoside triphosphates, and denatured N4 DNA. Under these conditions, initiation of RNA synthesis occurs exclusively with pppG. The enzyme is inhibited by monovalent salts and is resistant to the drugs rifampicin and streptolydigin. The protein is present in 1 to 2 copies per virion; its presence provides an explanation for the independence of N4 early RNA synthesis on the activity of the host RNA polymerase.'

aS'We have obtained evidence in vivo for the intracellular site of sialylation of glycoproteins and have determined the kinetics of intramembranous transport of newly synthesized sialoglycoproteins. Radioactivity of sialoglycoproteins was determined at different times in homogenate, smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and plasma membrane fractions of liver either from slices which had been incubated with radioactive N-acetylneuraminic acid or from mice which had been injected with radioactive sugar. At short times after labeling, the Golgi apparatus contained the highest specific activity of radioactive sialoglycoproteins and over half of the total cellular radioactive sialoglycoproteins. By 15 to 25 min, most of the radioactivity in the Golgi apparatus had decreased with a concomitant increase of radioactivity in the plasma membrane. Radioactivity in the smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum accounted for less than 20% of the total cellular radioactivity throughout. Control experiments indicated that leakage of soluble, labeled sialoglycoproteins from membrane vesicles and adsorption of them onto vesicles was minimal. In contrast to the above studies, labeling for short times with radioactive mannose, showed, as expected from studies in vitro, most of the radioactivity in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. At longer times, the radioactivity in the rough endoplasmic reticulum decreased, with an increase in the plasma membrane. Throughout, the radioactivity in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum was low.'

aS'The major aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex (the 24 S complex) isolated from rat liver, which contains lysyl-, leucyl-, and arginyl-tRNA synthetase activities, is dissociated into fully active free aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases by column chromatography on diaminooctyl-Sepharose. During the hydrophobic interaction chromatography, more than a quantitative yield of the lysyl-tRNA synthetase activity is obtained. The free lysyl-tRNA synthetase, dissociated from the synthetase complex, is purified about 2,000-fold with a 13% yield by conventional column chromatography. Lysyl-tRNA synthetase is also purified from the 24 S synthetase complex by affinity column chromatography on lysyl-diaminohexyl-Sepharose. Free lysyl-tRNA synthetase as dissociated from the synthetase complex, is evidently a dimeric enzyme with a subunit molecular weight of 66,000 +/- 3,000, as determined by gel electrophoresis, sucrose gradient centrifugation and gel filtration.'

aS'A DNA-dependent RNA polymerase has been extracted from vaccinia virions and purified to near homogeneity as judged by glycerol gradient sedimentation and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The native enzyme has a molecular weight of approximately 500,000 and can be dissociated into putative subunits of 140,000, 137,000, 37,000, 35,000, 31,000, 22,000, and 17,000 daltons. Activity was dependent on all four ribonucleoside triphosphates, Mn2+, and a DNA template. Optimal activity occurred at pH 7.9 in the presence of 90 mM KCl or 40 mM (NH4)2SO4. All single-stranded DNAs tested served as templates. By contrast, linear double-stranded DNAs were not effectively transcribed and very low activity was obtained with circular supercoiled DNAs which contain small single-stranded regions. The synthetic alternating copolymer poly(dA-dT), which forms a completely base-paired structure, also was not transcribed, whereas poly(dA,dT) and other random copolymers served as templates. Of the four homopolydeoxribonucleotides, only poly(dC) and poly(dT) were transcribed, suggesting that initiation specifically occurs with purine ribonucleotides. In support of this, higher Km values were obtained for GTP and ATP (333 and 80 micro M, respectively) than for UTP and CTP (22 and 12 micro M, respectively) using a DNA template. The RNA polymerase was inhibited by polyanions but was resistant to rifampicin and alpha-amanitin.'

aS"The irreversible inactivation by heat of the F1 and F2 regions of the beta 2 subunit of Escherichia coli tryptophan synthetase (L-serine hydrolyase (adding indole) EC 4.2.1.20) has been studied. By comparing the kinetics of inactivation of the F1 and F2 fragments, either isolated by proteolysis or associated within the beta 2 protein, it is shown that the F1 fragment is protected considerably against heat inactivation by its interactions with the complementary F2 fragment. An important stabilization of the protein conformation by the coenzyme, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, is also observed. By using a hybrid enzyme preparation, it is shown that the stabilization by a single pyridoxal 5'-phosphate molecule of the two protomers within beta 2 is likely to be caused by a strengthening of interdomain interactions upon binding of the coenzyme. These results point to a strong energetic coupling between the two domains of the beta chain."
